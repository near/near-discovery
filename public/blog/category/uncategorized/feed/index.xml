										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><em>By Bowen Wang, Director of Protocol</em> <br><br>In this post, the NEAR Protocol work group would like to provide an update of the protocol roadmap to show what <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-q2-protocol-roadmap-update">we accomplished in 2023</a> and what is planned for 2024.<br></p>



<p>TLDR: 2023 saw major experience improvements via meta transactions and zero-balance accounts, as well as node performance improvements and optimizations. Preparations are underway for a major upgrade to stateless validation, completing Phase 2 of the sharding roadmap in early 2024.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-accomplished-in-2023">What we accomplished in 2023</h2>



<p>There were a total of six protocol upgrades in 2023 which introduced a number of new protocol features. <strong>Meta transactions</strong> were added as a protocol feature at the beginning of the year to support gasless transactions, which means that users can transact on NEAR and start using apps without necessarily needing to pay transaction fees in NEAR. We also added <strong>zero-balance accounts</strong>, an important feature that enables users to create an account without holding NEAR to pay for storage. This makes it easy to onboard new users to applications. These two features form a solid foundation for a seamless onboarding experience for end users — a top goal for NEAR overall.<br></p>



<p>In addition to easy user onboarding, we have also been working hard to optimize the performance of NEAR. <strong>Flat storage</strong>, which was released in Q2 this year, optimized state reads and improved the stability and performance of the network overall. Another feature that optimizes NEAR nodes is <strong>cold storage</strong>, which allows for a split between hot and cold storage for a node. This means an archival node does not need to store most of the historical data on SSD and therefore can save a lot on cost. We also optimized the network communication between validator nodes by introducing the <strong>tier1 network</strong>, which reduces the latency of network messages between two validator nodes. Furthermore, we improved <strong>state sync</strong> and reduced the time it took a node to synchronize the latest state. We have also worked on improving the stability and maintainability of contract runtime with initiatives like finite wasm and limited replayability.<br></p>



<p>There are a few major initiatives that we started this year and expect to finish next year, such as stateless validation, congestion control, and transaction priority. We will dive deeper into those in the section below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plans-for-2024"><br>Plans for 2024</h2>



<p>There are a few major projects that we want to deliver in 2024 to improve the usability, scalability, and decentralization of NEAR Protocol:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stateless validation</strong>. Stateless validation is a major initiative that we have been working on for a few months. It adjusts the original Nightshade sharding design to avoid implementing fraud proofs while improving the performance of each shard significantly by putting state in memory. The stateless validation work is expected to be delivered in Q2 2024, which would also mark the completion of the original goal we set for Phase 2 of sharding. We expect the launch of stateless validation to also dramatically increase the throughput of each shard and prepare NEAR for the continued growth of usage.</li>



<li><strong>Congestion control and transaction priority</strong>. While NEAR’s sharding design is horizontally scalable, it is important to provide a good user experience when there is short-term congestion on the network. This includes localizing congestion so that gas price increase does not affect the entire network and allowing users to prioritize their transactions during congestion if they are willing to pay more in transaction fees.</li>



<li><strong>Support for account aggregation</strong>. Account aggregation allows a user to control accounts on different chains with one NEAR account, an important pillar of the chain abstraction vision for NEAR. It requires chain signatures, which does MPC to sign payload. This requires a new runtime API to facilitate the asynchronous nature of chain signatures.</li>



<li><strong>zkWASM</strong>. We have been working on zkWASM with the Polygon team for a few months and the work will continue in 2024. The goal is to build a prover for WebAssembly smart contracts. This could be used as a part of the initiative to prove the state transition of NEAR in a ZK proof. Moreover, zkWASM also provides wasm as an alternative execution environment to EVM for L2s.</li>



<li><strong>Data availability improvements</strong>. We launched <a href="https://near.org/data-availability">NEAR DA</a> in early November 2023 and there are a few things that we plan to work on to further improve the efficiency of NEAR DA. Those improvements include introducing KZG commitment to avoid having data availability fraud proofs, as well as real-time bridging to allow verification of data availability on Ethereum.</li>



<li><strong>Ethereum wallet support</strong>. Supporting wallets like MetaMask natively on NEAR allows us to attract more users to NEAR and also be more Ethereum aligned. This requires changes to the protocol to support Ethereum addresses natively and support processing of RLP serialized Ethereum transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Research into the future of sharding</strong>. There are two major directions of exploration: synchronous sharding and ZK-centric sharding. Synchronous sharding enables synchronous execution of smart contracts and addresses the developer experience pain point of having to deal with asynchronous execution. ZK-centric sharding leverages zero-knowledge proofs to validate state transition of different shards and improves the scalability and decentralization of the protocol. In addition, we will also research the next and final phase of sharding: dynamically adjusting the number of shards based on usage.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>The roadmap can be seen below for those interested in more timeline specifics. It is split into two parts: <strong>Experience </strong>and <strong>Core</strong>. The Experience section encompasses user and/or developer experience and the protocol features needed to enable those experiences. As an example, synchronous execution addresses the pain point that developers feel when they implement cross-contract calls. <br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="592" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Experience-1024x592.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21157" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Experience-1024x592.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Experience-300x174.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Experience-768x444.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Experience.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br>The Core section, on the other hand, covers major efforts to improve the scalability and decentralization of the protocol. This includes stateless validation, zkWASM, improvements to data availability, and so on.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="644" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Core-1024x644.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21158" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Core-1024x644.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Core-300x189.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Core-768x483.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Protocol-Roadmap-2024-Core.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br><br>As always, the protocol team is proud to have made several important improvements to the core protocol with zero disruption for users and developers. We look forward to making some major advancements in 2024 to help the entire NEAR ecosystem deliver its vision of mainstream adoption of an Open Web, where all internet users can control their own data, assets, and power of governance. <br><br>We will share more details on Phase 2 advancements and timelines soon. If you’d like to learn more, join the NEAR Protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/nearprotocol">X Spaces</a> on Tuesday, January 16 at 5pm UTC to hear from Director of Protocol Bowen Wang and NEAR Foundation CEO Illia Polosukhin on upcoming protocol developments.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the recent launch of the NEAR Blockchain Operating system (BOS) on <a href="http://near.org/">near.org</a>, came one of the first and most powerful features — FastAuth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With FastAuth, BOS users get a better than Web2-style onboarding experience, allowing them to easily create an account for any app on the BOS without a new password or the need to buy any crypto. And perhaps most powerfully for developers, FastAuth is both the easiest and fastest way to get people to try their new components and apps, yet another reason why developers will want to build on the BOS. This helps dramatically lower the threshold for adoption and opens the door to bringing billions of Web2 users into the Web3 space.</p>



<p>To get up to speed on FastAuth, here is a FastAuth primer with some product demo videos.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-easy-onboarding-and-email-recovery-with-fastauth">Easy onboarding and email recovery with FastAuth</h2>



<p>FastAuth gives users the power to quickly and easily create a single account that can be used for any website or app that integrates with the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). This feature makes FastAuth an ideal tool for developers building components on NEAR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a Web2-style onboarding experience that puts the user experience front and center, users can create a free account using biometrics, phone prompts, and an email address. This means that users can quickly interact with an app but also easily re-authenticate to the app using the same or different devices.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Create a Web3 Account in Seconds with Fast Auth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gN5XlpXz9gE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Since most users are accustomed to centralized authentication methods like “Sign in with Google”, Web3 account management using seed phrases and wallets have, until now, created a significant barrier to entry for many people. By combining FastAuth with decentralized email recovery, users no longer need to remember seed phrases or install third party wallet applications. Users can recover their accounts through a “Single Sign-on” (SSO) process with the email they used at registration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Account recovery is also decentralized and does not give custodial access to full access keys to any single custodian. It is accomplished through a process called “multi-party computation”. This finally paves a way for mass adoption with an easy, secure, and decentralized account recovery system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Account Recovery with NEAR&#039;s Fast Auth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pH-xLAZWQNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p><br>With FastAuth, one of the most challenging parts in onboarding users to Web3 no longer exists. Now, users can set up a BOS account quicker than creating a Gmail, Facebook, Tiktok, or Instagram account. And developers can deliver their Web3 components, apps, and experiences more seamlessly than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-third-party-applications-required">No third-party applications required</h2>



<p>FastAuth also removes the need to download any third-party applications. Everything just works seamlessly right from the browser on your desktop or mobile device.</p>



<p>By creating an easy, user-centric experience, FastAuth makes the open web accessible to everyone right from the get-go and opens the door to mainstream adoption. Anyone developing components on the BOS can leverage this user-friendly experience to quickly and intuitively get their apps in front of users.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-create-an-account-without-crypto">Create an account without crypto</h2>



<p>BOS FastAuth has another great trick up its sleeve. Until now, getting started in&nbsp; Web3 and interacting with apps meant acquiring crypto first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With FastAuth, new users can get started right away without having to buy or be gifted crypto. This is a game changer for developers, enterprises, and end-users alike. Through FastAuth’s use of NEAR’s Meta Transactions and Zero Balance Accounts, users can register an account free of charge. Developers can also use this to their advantage as Meta Transactions paired with relayers, which allow them to sponsor initial interactions for new users without needing to purchase $NEAR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This streamlined onboarding experience allows <strong>developers</strong> to significantly increase conversion rates for people trying their components and apps for the first time. FastAuth also expands an app and website’s audience by making it more accessible to mainstream users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FastAuth creates an easy way for <strong>enterprises</strong> to integrate Web3 and crypto technology into their business. With just a few lines of code, they can onboard existing users into powerful new community and commerce experiences that are accessible, highly secure , and decentralized.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>End users</strong> can also get started using Web3 apps and experiences in an easy, accessible way. Setting up a secure&nbsp; fully user-owned&nbsp; account now only takes seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-fastauth">What’s next for FastAuth&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While FastAuth is already enabling fast and simple onboarding of mainstream users as well as streamlining component-building for developers on the BOS, a number of other features and upgrades are already in the works:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>The ability to extend relayers and FastAuth to additional gateways beyond near.org</li>



<li>Further MPC decentralization</li>



<li>Multi-chain compatibility&nbsp;</li>



<li>Two-factor authentication</li>
</ul>



<p>Stay tuned to <a href="http://near.org/">near.org</a> for new FastAuth features and upgrades, as they are rolled out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>A few weeks ago, as part of a series of blogs on the state of funding, NEAR Foundation announced it would be examining its evolving <a href="/blog/evolving-near-foundations-funding-strategy/">funding strategy</a>. This is in line with the Foundation’s&nbsp; goal of providing a clear and concise update to continue to foster transparent communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, NEAR Foundation is actively working towards a more decentralized model of capital allocation that will initially involve the <a href="/about/network/working-groups/">DeveloperDAO</a>, <a href="https://gov.nearpages.wpengine.com/c/marketing/marketingdao/91">MarketingDAO</a>, <a href="https://gov.nearpages.wpengine.com/c/creatives/creatives-dao/61">CreativesDAO</a>, with an additional DAO that will begin formation in Q1 of 2023. This will impact the ecosystem in the following ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>Effective immediately, <strong>NEAR Foundation will cease allocating capital directly from our inbound start-up grants program</strong>, with the exception of our current events grants, which will be handed over to the MarketingDAO when they are set up to manage them.  Request events funding by following the steps <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0kw-kV1iDa-3h6bMA9MEdmdJal8w5yiLH56K9hfKBE/edit?usp=sharing">outlined here</a>.</li>



<li>In January and February, we will be working directly with community members to outline a clear application process for funding via the DAOs. Processing time is expected to take 6-8 weeks. If you are interested in helping us form the new DAO with a focus on start-up projects, please submit your interest using this <a href="https://forms.gle/SZf1fqJpBKFPWbf9A">contact form</a>.</li>



<li>Any&nbsp; projects that have already received a portion of their funding and are working towards their agreed milestones will <strong>continue to be supported through the remaining milestones</strong>.</li>



<li>Any application that is not already in the approval stage will not receive funding. However, we will do our best to redirect you to appropriate, alternative funding sources.</li>
</ol>



<p>NEAR Foundation’s goal is to empower the ecosystem to make decisions that support&nbsp; the strategic approach that will drive NEAR&nbsp; to the next phase of its roadmap, with a look ahead at new areas of product and development, as outlined in the <a href="/blog/near-strategic-update-and-outlook-for-2023/">NEAR Strategic Update and Outlook for 2023</a>. We will continue to be as transparent as possible about the new funding strategy as it rolls out. The Foundation will communicate as often, and as frequently, as possible. We encourage the community to continue providing meaningful feedback so we can iterate more quickly as we unite to build the NEAR Ecosystem together.</p>

<p>NEAR’s ever-growing and engaged community is one of the ecosystem’s greatest strengths. Remember the <a href="https://medium.com/nearprotocol/refer-and-earn-pick-projects-you-love-and-get-up-to-10-000-in-near-981c0c015ba4#:~:text=Refer%20and%20Earn.,for%20nominating%20a%20worthy%20project">NEAR Foundation Grants team’s Refer-and-Earn Program</a>? A number of NEAR community members participated in Refer-and-Earn in early 2022, resulting in grants for dozens of exciting projects currently building on the NEAR ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Foundation has had the pleasure of seeing the community being a key contributor in providing ecosystem support and building dapps. The community does this in a number of ways, including running and sponsoring events, educating developers and entrepreneurs on the benefits of NEAR, bringing projects with active user bases from other chains, and so on.</p>



<p>NEAR Foundation wants to build on the community’s successes through a new incentive structure that aligns with the Grants Program (more information can be found at the Grants Program Handbook here bit.ly/Grants-Program-Handbook).&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>The payout for each project referred will be awarded a total of 10% of the project awarded grant amount. This amount is awarded in nUSDC (wrapped USDC on NEAR) and is calculated at the end of each quarter.</li>



<li>The first half of the 5% will be awarded at the point of the contract signed.</li>



<li>The second half of the 5% will be awarded once all project milestones are completed.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-refer-and-earn-q3-qualified-projects">Refer-and-Earn: Q3 Qualified Projects</h2>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem receives a number of your recommendations and referrals. A total of 12 quality projects emerged from Refer-and-Earn, each aligning with NEAR Foundation’s Grants program objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In no particular order, here are the Q3 2022 qualified projects:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Scene&nbsp;</li>



<li>Azadi Record</li>



<li>Vital Carbon&nbsp;</li>



<li>Metavision Games&nbsp;</li>



<li>Murder Mystery Collective&nbsp;</li>



<li>MetaLordz&nbsp;</li>



<li>Klabrate and ClimaFi</li>



<li>Meteor wallet&nbsp;</li>



<li>Mintmade&nbsp;</li>



<li>NEARKai</li>



<li>EVIE Marketplace&nbsp;</li>



<li>Autify&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The Grants team has reached out to all Refer-and-Earn referrers. Thanks to your help and support, the Grants team is able to support innovative projects like those listed above. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a groundbreaking and innovative move, NEAR has partnered with <a href="https://gruponutresa.com/">Grupo Nutresa</a>, one of the most important processors of food in South America, to bring Web3 to the grocery industry. This will see Grupo Nutresa building one of the first open-source loyalty points programs on NEAR with long-term aspirations to reach a million users in Colombia and Latin America. The partnership was established through the support of tech firm Peersyst.</p>



<p>Grupo Nutresa customers will in turn gain more autonomy and control of their rewards. Customers will also get additional security and the reassurance that points will not be stolen or denied, and can be transferred more efficiently. Leveraging NEAR’s technology will also increase usability and accessibility of the rewards system as a whole, saving customers from having to create multiple accounts or different logins for multiple platforms — they just need their easy to use NEAR wallet.</p>



<p>“We are excited to partner with one of the biggest multinationals in Latin America and help it to lead the way through its first Web3 loyalty programme,” says NEAR Foundation CEO Marieke Flament. “Leveraging NEAR’s first-rate technology, the partnership will redefine what is possible when combining retail with the latest blockchain innovation, not just in Latin America but throughout the rest of the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-usability-is-key-to-loyalty">Usability is key to loyalty</h2>



<p>Rewarding customers for their support has always been a priority for the world’s top brands. Such programs not only engage customers and deliver incentives for them to return but also act as analytical tools, giving businesses insights into customers’ behaviour and preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.annexcloud.com/blog/loyalty-program-statistics-will-make-rethink-marketing/">87% of shoppers</a> reporting they want brands to have loyalty programs and <a href="https://info.bondbrandloyalty.com/the-2016-bond-loyalty-report-press-release-us">over 70% of consumers</a> more likely to recommend a brand with a robust loyalty program, Web3 and digital wallets are pushing forward-thinking brands to explore new opportunities on platforms that are easy to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the biggest multinationals in Colombia, Grupo Nutresa manages several loyalty programs for its customers, collaborators, and providers. Those loyalty programs are now coming together into a single easy-to-use platform underpinned by blockchain technology, through support from Spanish technology company Peersyst Technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Onboarding the masses into NEAR and Web3</h2>



<p>Grupo Nutresa sees NEAR as the ideal partner for these types of loyalty programs. NEAR Foundation sees the Grupo Nutresa partnership as a great opportunity to onboard the masses into the NEAR and Web3 ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our purpose is to make people feel recognized and valued by brands. Above all, what interests us most is that this is an opportunity to help build their dreams, through a service that provides them with significant redemption options and value,” says &nbsp;Fabián Andrés Restrepo, Digital Transformation Leader at Grupo Nutresa. “This invitation is also addressed to companies that want to help make people&#8217;s dreams come true and reward their loyal customers, by becoming an ally of Grupo Nutresa and its portfolio of businesses. We see in NEAR an important ally for developing and implementing Grupo Nutresa’s loyalty strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR’s sustainability credentials also align with Grupo Nutresa’s own business strategy and deep commitment to create value for society as a whole. According to the 2021 Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, Grupo Nutresa has been voted as the most sustainable food company in the world for two consecutive years, thanks to its effective implementation of social, environmental, and economic practices.&nbsp;</p>
