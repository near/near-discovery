<p>Validators are the backbone of the NEAR Protocol, playing an integral role in upholding the network&#8217;s core values now and into the future. Validators ensure that NEAR Protocol remains scalable, user-friendly, secure, trustworthy, and most importantly, decentralized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR validators provided community feedback on how to improve the validator experience, and we collectively listened. Responses suggested that routes to secure funding were unclear, and that existing delegations from the NEAR Foundation lacked transparency.<br>The result of the community feedback process is a new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjQ75peBJlUkxHvx9u4o0Dbsy-t5ofbEaXvKzY3shco/edit">NEAR Protocol Validator Delegation Proposal</a> and an open call RFP to coordinate the NEAR Protocol Institutional Validator Programme. The RFP will be open until Monday September 24th, 2023.</p>



<p>Drafted in collaboration with a number of ecosystem participants — Meta Pool, Banyan Collective, DevHub, Pagoda, Proximity, Validator Community, and NEAR Foundation — this proposal creates a framework for a refreshed validator delegation structure. It clearly defines a number of expectations for validators, aims to align incentives, assigns ownership, and enhances transparency around securing funding support.</p>



<p>The proposal’s framework addresses <strong>three</strong> <strong>delegation tracks</strong> — <strong>community validators, institutional validators, and 100% fee project validators</strong> — with the goals of improving transparency, strengthening the Nakamoto coefficient of the NEAR Protocol, and increasing validator selection at custody providers: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Community Validators</strong> — Individual participants or smaller entities within the NEAR Protocol ecosystem who choose to operate validator nodes. They are strong advocates of NEAR Protocol’s principles and values, and actively contribute to the decentralization and security of the blockchain. The proposal addresses issues that Community Validators face, including resource constraints, rewards, vulnerability to attacks, and limited influence, building on new proposals for Community validators put forward in <a href="https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.activity?handle=validators">June</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Institutional Validators</strong> — Typically large entities, such as companies, financial institutions, or well-established organizations. They often have significant resources and stake in the NEAR Protocol, which allows them to operate powerful and reliable infrastructure to maintain the blockchain. This proposal addresses concerns around institutional validators such as network centralization, lack of community inclusivity, and inequality in influence.</li>



<li><strong>100% Fee Project Validators</strong>&nbsp; — A track to support growth activities resulting in onboarding of users to the NEAR Protocol, and continued engagement through retention programmes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Firstly, check out the full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjQ75peBJlUkxHvx9u4o0Dbsy-t5ofbEaXvKzY3shco/edit">NEAR Protocol Validator Delegation Proposal</a> and provide any feedback publicly <a href="https://near.org/devgovgigs.near/widget/gigs-board.pages.community.activity?handle=validators">here</a>. Your feedback is greatly appreciated to improve the proposal.</p>



<p>Secondly, since this is an open call RFP to run the NEAR Protocol Institutional Validator programme, please return any applications to finance@near.foundation.</p>



<p>Additionally, Restaking is coming to NEAR courtesy of Octopus Network. Under Octopus 2.0, $NEAR stakers will have the ability to secure appchains with their staked $NEAR. Find out more <a href="https://oct.network/">here</a></p>



<p>Many thanks for your continued support to improve the validator experience and help secure the NEAR Protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://near.org/s/p?a=pagodaplatform.near&amp;b=88979940">Q1 protocol roadmap update</a> was well received by the community. Pagoda committed to&nbsp; continuing to share quarterly roadmap updates, so here is the update for Q2 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-protocol-team-accomplished-in-q2">What the protocol team accomplished in Q2</h2>



<p>Pagoda made good progress on <a href="https://near.org/s/p?a=pagodaplatform.near&amp;b=88979940">the protocol roadmap</a> in Q2. For the experience section, there is now <a href="https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/480">a NEP on account namespaces</a>, a key stepping stone towards account extension. Account extension would allow users to easily compose different modules such as multisig, proxy, and so on. In addition, Aurora submitted <a href="https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/481">a NEP on wasm submodules</a>, which, if implemented, would enable a limited form of synchronous execution, or allowing transactions that touch multiple contracts to settle within a single block. Both proposals are still works in progress due to the complexity of the changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of these two proposed changes, there is <a href="https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/485">a NEP on shared storage for contract code</a> which could significantly lower the cost of deploying a common contract. These proposals aspire to bring to life the account extension idea, which allows an account to install different modules to different functionalities such as multisig, recovery, proxy, and so on.</p>



<p>For the core section of the roadmap, Pagoda delivered a few important improvements this quarter. Flat storage with value inlining is live on mainnet and brings an 8x improvement to state reads. Work on background writes is also in progress and the protocol team’s initial experiments show that it can potentially reduce the cost of state writes by 3x. In addition, cold storage is fully live on mainnet and drastically reduces the cost of running an archival node.</p>



<p>Pagoda has also made good progress to revamp state sync. With the growth of mainnet state, the previous version of state sync was too inefficient and practically unusable. The new state sync, which uses flat storage to speed up state part generation, allows a node to finish syncing mainnet state within 3 hours. The team is expected to deliver the fully functional version of the new state sync in Q3.</p>



<p>The team has also delivered <a href="https://github.com/near/finite-wasm">finite wasm</a> and its integration with nearcore, which improves the security and robustness of NEAR’s contract runtime immensely.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-updates-to-the-roadmap">Updates to the roadmap</h2>



<p>The experience section of the roadmap remains mostly the same, with two changes worth highlighting. One shift is that the changes required to implement account extension are temporarily on hold as we would like to see the impact on user experience by first emulating the changes through smart contracts. Another change is that the protocol team will work on the <a href="https://gov.near.org/t/proposal-locking-account-storage-refunds-to-avoid-faucet-draining-attacks/34155?u=jakmeier">storage refund problem</a> to prevent potential faucet-draining attacks in the new onboarding experience.</p>

<p>For the core section of the roadmap, the focus in Q3 will shift to Phase 2 of sharding, which includes both resharding the current mainnet state and turning off the requirement that block producers have to track all shards. This endeavor will take more than one quarter to finish and we will post more updates as we iron out details of the design.</p>
