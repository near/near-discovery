<p>Transparency continues to be a core focus of the NEAR Fondation, so every week it will publish data to assess the health of the ecosystem. This is to aid the NEAR community in understanding the current state of NEAR across key metrics. The Weekly On Chain Data Report will also appear at the top of quarterly reports as well as monthly funding reports.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="/blog/near-foundation-transparency-report/">Quarterly Transparency Reports.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read the <a href="/blog/near-foundation-transparency-report-q3-2022/">Q3 Transparency Report</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Last week’s &nbsp;<a href="/blog/near-transparency-report-december-9/">On-Chain Data Report.</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-importance-of-transparency"><strong>The Importance of Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>The NEAR Foundation has been committed to transparency since inception. It values openness to all stakeholders, including investors, builders, and creators. The Foundation’s focus on openness to the entire community will always be a core tenet.</p>



<p>The Foundation values the community’s continued support and feedback as it publishes these reports. It’s part of the Foundation’s ongoing response to the community to provide as much transparency as possible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-accounts-and-active-accounts"><strong>New Accounts and Active Accounts</strong></h2>



<p>Daily new account (or new wallet) creation ended the week at around 17,000 per day. This is a slight decline from last week, which ended with&nbsp; 20,000 daily new accounts. The peak for this week was logged on December 20th when 19,000 new wallets were created. Put into context, roughly 14,300 wallets were being created daily at the start of December, making it a positive month for new accounts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UocX6mD8bQBt1rRrtIUg7BLmCgCkbwaSTJpdCJam5R_9X03VPRIY6AuL7I0tpKUmGOJ4vok1CUDEPhJ-xTJdH3_Ufkb4KsZXXFB5pakODohgCXf7fq2gChMbVE6mFZT4v9meDsJEI0wuGxQM79gOWPjhMPNuSqHC3X_2c7GBBe4w1jRq4_j4xImqlmvf6A" alt=""/></figure>



<p>If a NEAR wallet makes an on-chain transaction, it’s counted in the Daily Number of Active Accounts metric. This past week, Daily Active Accounts ranged between 39,266 on December 18th to 46,235 on the 19th of the month. This is still well above August and September’s numbers, where Daily Active Accounts hovered around 10,000 with a Q4 2022 high of 183,000 accounts active logged on September 14.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uvnRw0kr-e5sBBxD-PLDE2WFxFmPaP2f3xMgeTBufOjb2nAb-QoesGCF-NqDme2qeGoppk2Toi4Ugbg-oRg4HBmTlvwpG5Ns51H4YSAB_gxwTgjKrPJ4newOfsJIU-6P6enbLng28oczu1_GxBq8dki9did8zQ2N54sw9oqwQU6rywfefSdCpcu2uaTJsQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-contracts-and-active-contracts"><strong>New Contracts and Active Contracts</strong></h2>



<p>Smart contracts built on the NEAR blockchain are programs that automatically execute when certain parameters are met. By examining the Daily Number of New Contracts created, the community can get a better sense of how healthy the ecosystem is and its growth as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more new smart contracts are being actively executed, the more projects and users are engaging with NEAR. There was a substantial increase in the number of daily new contracts to end the week, climbing from 28 on the 17th to 46 by the 21st. This high of the last 7 days&nbsp; was 63 on the 16th, and the low was 26 on December 18th.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JAu6uAdn4mo_LGHJdz2tAryhXkcbxnCtoc0RKauXc-wvrxyp6NTsnxc7zP8ddiMOPLp78GKEYmVmtq_m_74ludx998I4Q7n28QN4kFj9On4DRyWh2WAMgSIFhKbH_2MFUbTBd5btW4cUldv5wZCIgT81bgI1ACJgYkXgImAmyZ3EBkNevxnmdDcM8lw4qg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Daily Number of Active Contracts measures contracts that were executed within a 24-hour time span. This ranged from a high of 797 on December 15th to a low of 535 on the 18th. These numbers are still well above the beginning of the year, where there were roughly between 200 to 400 daily active contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Aaet6Z4T92jEeg3T3HxxDXz7YYdE_uXzXzZTDXojYAtJiiJIs_icp08wqgHaHMWU99tTtBYWkr8OZmg3KB6ZckX7aszZplbiAtciLvqNBm0trOgnbN5ET6-aDIKiUpkRmlNAzMQBMpTZVoLCZwqnbxYjEo8p_PAEtO2i4gNzF9AKfab48FWGrPCCo9fe2A" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-used-gas-and-gas-fee"><strong>Used Gas and Gas Fee</strong></h2>



<p>Gas Fees are the costs associated with conducting transactions on the NEAR network and blockchain. Validators for the network are compensated using Gas Fees for their services, incentivizing validators needed to secure the network.</p>



<p>Over the last week, Used Gas on the NEAR network (or PetaGas) declined slightly from 7,489 on the 15th, ending the week at 6,226. This is fairly consistent with the entire month of December, indicating that individuals are on the network and transacting regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ac1UrZ0PYMap--f6hvBGvQnKMD-jW1DVga2--SWY3RnNJ1NV2hqO7HaKW6T7Ai2hIi3tEBMTRa2bflS88b0r6GXL7-ty_4bOV2ipMj0lG74rsBDE8TZiIEnTp9w6JXG5EUaqjj9RG2-BEtrh2-OsS0Q2zRlSipRhamTuwp2rlpCujjD9kDBH8XQh-ixO-w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>During this past week, there has been a slight drop in the Gas Fee, which correlates with a drop in Used Gas. On December 18th, the Gas Fee was measured at 570, before peaking to 676 the following day. The rest of this week has hovered around 622.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fPEn5A3N-ghx9yqfTo7nPJloKeu5eLlJbnwzYatK12msDkg0gwk-klI-scSzoRwFENs8GLHgnr9TZlRlZz4LiWrEpAKBa5hMqFkt6mtBs3-JwaNzxku6r8AzYt_hZBgHztwSUQYGF8-ADoLzv5M6IeP4d-VX1m80_saoY1ElfWMKswevwQO1XUK1iYFsmQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-transactions"><strong>Daily Transactions</strong></h2>



<p>Finally, the Daily Number of Transactions shows how many times the blockchain logged a transaction over the past week. This week’s figures indicate a slight decrease from 454,757 on the 16th of December to 332,708 on the 21st.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dCVK_QjHTGwfiqtnYYSPYzZtpGPQRz0hljHNUBzfx6hwF08o-uMKUZDL9rWHm68npfP5HpB700rSBu-zKNJ9e_OXN0qcHe9dl1lt7ZqAKB-SQZ_gzeF_KBMPC5m3VKnUizb5A2vU7XF-q85hdJ8g6K9ztgRP6oC9-VOiP_fVn5LmplECwkTxgjAjy7B0OQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These reports are generated every week and published on Friday.</p>

<p>As part of the Foundation’s commitment to transparency, each week it will publish data to help the NEAR community understand the health of the ecosystem. This will be on top of the quarterly reports, and the now monthly funding reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="/blog/near-foundation-transparency-report/">You can find the Quarterly Transparency Reports here.</a> (The Q3 report will be published next week.)</p>



<p><a href="/blog/near-transparency-report-december-9/">Last week’s On-Chain Data Report can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-importance-of-transparency"><strong>The Importance of Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>Transparency has always been one of NEAR Foundation’s core beliefs. Openness to the community, investors, builders, and creators is one of the core tenets of being a Web3 project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent months, in response to community frustration, the Foundation has endeavored to do more. This NEAR Weekly On-Chain Data Report is just one of the ways in which the Foundation is being more proactively transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New Accounts and Active Accounts</strong></h2>



<p>New Accounts are defined as new wallets created on the NEAR blockchain. While there was a decline in new accounts between the last week of November and the first week of December, this figure rose from an average of 14,000 per day to approximately 24,000 per day this week. New accounts reached a weekly high of 25,001 on December 12th.</p>



<p>This puts last week’s New Accounts data in line with November’s average figure of 24,000 wallets per 24 hours. As noted last week, the peak for account creation in Q4 was September 13, during which 130,000 new wallets were created in a single day. Collectively, these numbers equate to nearly 2M  total wallets on the NEAR blockchain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="537" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-1024x537.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19595" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-1024x537.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-300x157.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-768x403.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-1536x806.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Accounts-2048x1075.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Daily Number of Active Accounts measures the number of NEAR wallets making on-chain transactions. Over the last week, Active Accounts hit a high of 92,440 before trending down to about 51,000 per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Historically, there have been highs of more than 100,000 active accounts on NEAR. The  high for Active Accounts on any one day in Q4 of 2022 was logged on September 14, during which 183,000 accounts were active.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19596" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-1024x538.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-300x158.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-768x404.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-1536x807.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Accounts-2048x1076.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New Contracts and Active Contracts</strong></h2>



<p>Smart contracts created on NEAR are programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. The Daily Number of New Contracts is valuable as a metric because it gives the community a way of measuring the NEAR ecosystem’s health and growth. If there are more active contracts, it follows that projects are more actively engaging with the NEAR protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week, the daily number of New Contract has been trending upward, whereas last week it rose and fell. A low of 17 New Contracts was measured on December 11th,, before falling to 50 on the 14th. A weekly high of 57 contracts were created on December 13th. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="532" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-1024x532.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19597" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-1024x532.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-300x156.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-768x399.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-1536x798.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-New-Contracts-2048x1064.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Active Contracts measure contracts executed during a 24-hour period. This metric also trended upward this week, with 640 measured on December 11th and and a high of 797 Active Contracts created on December 13th. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="482" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-1024x482.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19598" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-1024x482.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-300x141.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-768x361.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-1536x723.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-of-Active-Contracts-2048x964.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Used Gas and Gas Fee</strong></h2>



<p>Gas Fees is a term used to describe the cost of making transactions on the NEAR network. These fees are paid to validators for the network services they provide to the NEAR blockchain. Gas fees incentivize validators to secure the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the last week, Used Gas on NEAR (PetaGas) was measured at a high of 7,569 on December 11th and 6,758 on the 14th. To learn more about Gas on NEAR, check out the <a href="/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/">NEAR White Paper</a>. (Rises in gas used can be attributed to many factors, with a common one being increased user activity on the NEAR network.) </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19599" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-1024x538.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-300x158.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-768x403.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-1536x807.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Amount-of-Used-Gas-2048x1076.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Over the last week, there has been a slight drop in the Gas Fee (in NEAR), which correlates with a drop in Used Gas. On December 11th, the Gas Fee was measured at 756, before falling to 675 on the 14th. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="534" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-1024x534.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-1024x534.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-300x156.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-768x400.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-1536x801.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NEAR-Daily-Gas-Fee-in-NEAR-2048x1068.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Daily Transactions</strong></h2>



<p>The Daily Number of Transactions illustrates the number of times the blockchain logged a transaction. The data from this week showcases an increase in the number of transactions, which was also the case over the previous week. Daily Number of Transactions hit a weekly high of 439,660 on December 11th before falling to 373,335 on the 14th.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the Foundation’s commitment to transparency, each week it will publish data to help the NEAR community understand the health of the ecosystem. This will be on top of the quarterly reports, and the now monthly funding reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="/blog/near-foundation-transparency-report/">You can find the quarterly reports here.</a></p>



<p><a href="/blog/near-foundation-funding-team-report-september-2022/">You can find monthly reports on funding here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="/blog/near-transparency-report-december-2/">Last week’s transparency report can be found here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The importance of transparency</h2>



<p>The NEAR Foundation has always held transparency as one of its core beliefs. Being open to the community, investors, builders and creators is one of the core tenets of being a Web3 project. But it’s become apparent the Foundation needs to do more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Foundation hears the frustration from the community, and it wants to be more pro-active in when and how it communicates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-accounts-and-active-accounts">New Accounts and Active Accounts</h2>



<p>New Accounts are new wallets being created on the NEAR blockchain. In the last days of November and the first days of December, the daily number of new accounts had been declining. This week however, activity has been trending up, with the average number of new accounts averaging 14,000 per day, with a weekly peak of 14,752 recorded on December 6.</p>



<p>This is down on November&#8217;s figure of 24,000 wallets per 24 hours, on average. These numbers are conducive with the overall decline in sentiment around blockchain. </p>



<p>Looking more broadly, the peak for account creation in Q4 was September 13 where 130,000 new wallets were created in one day. Collectively, these numbers equate to 22,551,000 total wallets on the NEAR blockchain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="579" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51-1024x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19509" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51-1024x579.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51-300x170.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51-768x434.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51-1536x868.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.19.51.png 1808w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Daily Number of Active Accounts is a measure of how many wallets on NEAR are making transactions on chain. Over the last week, the number of daily active accounts has oscillated between a a low of 12,639 on December 5, to a peak of 14,752 on December 6. </p>



<p>Historically, this is a decline from highs of more than 100,000 active accounts on the network. The highest number of active accounts on any one day in Q4 this year was logged on September 14, where 183,000 accounts were active.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New Contracts and Active Contracts</h2>



<p>Contracts on NEAR are&nbsp;simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. The Daily Number of New Contracts is a valuable metric for understanding the health and growth of an ecosystem.</p>



<p>The more active contracts there are, the more projects are actively engaging with the NEAR protocol. The chart below shows a cyclical rhythm to new contracts, with rises and falls. Over the last seven days, the number of new contracts reached a daily high of 54 on December 4, and a weekly low of 27 on December 6. This range is broader compared to the week before, with last week&#8217;s highest number of 44 on November 30, to a low of 12 new contracts on November 27. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="579" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12-1024x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19511" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12-1024x579.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12-300x170.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12-768x435.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12-1536x869.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.20.12.png 1824w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Active contracts is a measure of contracts that execute in a 24 hour period. This number has remained consistent throughout the last week with an average of more than 600 active contracts on the NEAR network. Taking a historical perspective on these numbers, the average has declined in Q4, with previous highs in active contract activity coming in the third week of September 2022.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Used Gas and Gas Fee</h2>



<p>Gas Fees are a catch all term for the cost of making transactions on the NEAR network. These fees are paid to validators for their services to the blockchain. Without these fees, there would be no incentive for anyone to keep the network secure.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Over the last week, the daily amount of gas, expressed here as PetaGas, which is the equivalent of 0.1 $NEAR, has maintained a fairly consistent value between 5,949 PetaGas and 6,743 PetaGas. To learn more about Gas on NEAR, there is an excellent explainer in the&nbsp;<a href="/papers/the-official-near-white-paper/">NEAR White Paper</a>. Compared with last week, the Daily Amount of Used Gas has decreased, from highs of more than 8,000 PetaGas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="586" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10-1024x586.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19513" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10-1024x586.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10-300x172.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10-768x440.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10-1536x880.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-09.17.10.png 1802w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Daily Amount of Gas correlates with the Daily Gas Fee used on the network. Over the last week, there has been an uptick in the amount of Gas used, which can be brought on by a number of different factors. One of the most common is increased activity among users of the network.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29-1024x585.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19524" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29-1024x585.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29-300x172.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29-768x439.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29-1536x878.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-09-at-10.20.29.png 1840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Daily Transactions</h2>



<p>The daily number of transactions is a record of how many times the blockchain logged a transaction. This week&#8217;s data represents a healthy increase in the number of transactions. From lows of 328,000 transactions on December 3, to a weekly high of 388,000 transactions per day on December 6. Looking more broadly, NEAR transaction activity has been trending downwards in Q4, reflecting other on chain data presented here. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NEAR’s ever-growing and engaged community is one of the ecosystem’s greatest strengths. Remember the <a href="https://medium.com/nearprotocol/refer-and-earn-pick-projects-you-love-and-get-up-to-10-000-in-near-981c0c015ba4#:~:text=Refer%20and%20Earn.,for%20nominating%20a%20worthy%20project">NEAR Foundation Grants team’s Refer-and-Earn bonus scheme</a>? A number of NEAR community members participated in Refer-and-Earn in early 2022, resulting in grants for dozens of exciting projects currently building on the NEAR ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To demonstrate the power of the NEAR community, the Grants team just published its Refer-and-Earn Q2 2022 Report. Let’s take a look at the qualified projects currently building without limits that emerged from the Grants team’s Refer-and-Earn program.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-refer-and-earn-q2-qualified-projects">Refer-and-Earn: Q2 Qualified Projects</h2>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem is the beneficiary of a number of your recommendations and referrals. A total of 26 quality projects emerged from Refer-and-Earn—each aligning with the NEAR Foundation’s Grants program objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In no particular order, here are the Q2 2022 qualified projects:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Ref finance&nbsp;</li><li>Roco Finance&nbsp;</li><li>Lazy Learning</li><li>Noft Games&nbsp;</li><li>Atocha Protocol&nbsp;</li><li>Bast.gg</li><li>Omnia Defi</li><li>KwikTrust</li><li>BlockHealth&nbsp;</li><li>Marnotaur</li><li>Exxaverse&nbsp;</li><li>Mambo Heritage</li><li>NEAR mates&nbsp;</li><li>NFT Design Work&nbsp;</li><li>The Gorilla Squad</li><li>Pawn Protocol&nbsp;</li><li>PureFi</li><li>Solely NFT&nbsp;</li><li>Kyoto protocol&nbsp;</li><li>Deepwaters</li><li>Bumper Finance&nbsp;</li><li>Dojo Finance&nbsp;</li><li>Loozr&nbsp;</li><li>bit brawl</li><li>Blockperks</li><li>Boundless Pay</li></ol>



<p>The Grants team has reached out to all Refer-and-Earn referrers. Thanks to your help and support, the Grants team is able to support innovative projects such as those listed above.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-start-referring-projects-to-near-grants-today">Start referring projects to NEAR Grants today</h2>



<p>The Grants team would like to extend an invite to those yet to participate in the Refer-and-Earn program. To get started, head over to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmWs5vfKC7KZBnR8a7Z42nFEZOuoZ7496A_Til8ukgqjAeyA/viewform">NEAR Grants Program Referral Initiative page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please note that only projects receiving a grant directly from NEAR Foundation will be eligible for the Refer-and-Earn bonus. Only the first recorded referral will be paid out—duplicate records will not be considered. NEAR Foundation no longer supports DeFi-related projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All referrals are calculated at the end of each quarter and only eligible referrals will be contacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please contact grants@near.foundation for additional information or inquiries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Anyone who made the trip to Lisbon for NEARCON 2022, or tuned in via the YouTube livestream or Twitter, knew NEARCON was a smashing success. The vibe was something to behold. From devs and builders to other visionaries and champions of NEAR, NEARCON showcased the ecosystem and community at its very best—with boundless energy for creating without limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an energy that was also palpable to the press. Everything came together to produce&nbsp; awe-inspiring momentum that is being sustained well beyond NEARCON’s aftermath.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at NEAR by the numbers in the wake of NEARCON to see just how the NEAR community is building without limits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-20m-accounts-and-200m-transactions">20M Accounts and 200M Transactions&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Coming out of NEARCON, the total amount of NEAR accounts hit a new high of 20 million. To be sure, this was an ecosystem and community effort. But Sweat Economy, who presented at NEARCON, is responsible for onboarding 14 million new users into the NEAR ecosystem with their move-to-earn app. That’s 20x growth since this time last year!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to NEAR’s Nightshade sharding—Phase 1 of which was announced at NEARCON—this onboarding of the masses unfolded without a hitch. This example of NEAR’s infinite capacity is proof that it can welcome millions more users across the 800+ apps running on the protocol.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, NEAR also hit a new milestone of 200 million on-chain transactions. Next up? 250 million. The ecosystem is growing by leaps and bounds, and doing so in a crypto winter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-21-global-media-partners">21 Global Media Partners</h2>



<p>NEARCON was a major hit this year with members of the international press.&nbsp; All told, the conference attracted 21 global media partners, with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a> leading the pack as NEAR’s top tier sponsor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other major media outlets joined NEAR from around the world, including Cointelegraph, the Defiant, Coinpost Japan, W3volution Spain, and Business Insider Africa.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-over-250-pieces-of-media-coverage">Over 250 Pieces of Media Coverage</h2>



<p>Naturally, with so many global media partners, there is quite a lot of great news to share. Seven NEAR announcements and five partnership stories were pushed out to the global media.&nbsp; All together these ecosystem stories attracted 256+ pieces of coverage including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgQF-g-S0NY">fantastic show roundup video by CryptoBanter</a>, a hugely influential crypto YouTube channel that has over half a million subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While US media outlets led with most of the NEARCON coverage, NEAR’s flagship conference also saw consistent reporting from media in India, Korea, Vietnam and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-media-coverage-breakdown-by-country">Media Coverage Breakdown by Country</h3>



<ol><li>Africa &#8211; 5 pieces of coverage</li><li>Brazil &#8211; 5 pieces of coverage</li><li>China &#8211; 5 pieces of coverage</li><li>French &#8211; 8 pieces of coverage</li><li>German &#8211; 2 pieces of coverage</li><li>Italy &#8211; 4 pieces of coverage</li><li>India &#8211; 18 pieces of coverage</li><li>Japan &#8211; 2 pieces of coverage</li><li>Korea &#8211; 11 pieces of coverage</li><li>Spain &#8211; 5 pieces of coverage </li><li>UK &#8211; 12 pieces of coverage</li><li>US &#8211; 25 pieces of coverage</li><li>Vietnam &#8211; 5 pieces of coverage</li><li>Global &#8211; 150+pieces of coverage</li></ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-100m-entertainment-fund">$100M Entertainment Fund</h2>



<p>Perhaps the biggest story to come out of NEARCON was the launch of NEAR’s $100 million entertainment fund. It captivated the press, appearing in coverage from international news outlets such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/layer1-blockchain-protocol-near-launches-100m-vc-fund-targetingweb3-culture-and-entertainment/">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/swiss-based-near-foundation-announces-100m-fund-focused-web3-developers-3612182">International Business Times</a>, <a href="https://journalducoin.com/defi/defi-near-100-millions-dollars-ethereum/">Journal Du Coin</a> France, China’s leading crypto title <a href="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/354nv0vl.html">Panony </a>, <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=386703">CoinPost Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.coinpress.co.kr/2022/09/13/38193/">Coin Press Korea</a>.</p>



<p>And rightly so. By partnering with Caerus for this new $100 VC Fund and Lab, NEAR will help push new Web3 innovation in culture, media, and entertainment. This fund now places NEAR at the forefront of changing how creative projects are financed, produced, and distributed, as well as how it’s consumed, owned, and monetized.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-11-visionary-women-of-web3-changemakers">11 Visionary ‘Women of Web3 Changemakers’</h2>



<p>Another big campaign launched at NEARCON—the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2ZNKEKNNYMNWmDVOTdc2eLX8SZxEtaeCSc8I34-MUg/edit#">Women of Web3 Changemakers</a>. A partnership with <a href="https://forkast.news/why-crypto-needs-more-women/">Forkast News</a>, thisinitiative celebrated 11 exceptional women shaping the future of Web3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The campaign attracted a great deal of interest from a global audience, with mentions in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/recent-videos/nft-double-disruption-web3-women-celebrated/">CoinDesk</a>, <a href="https://ffnews.com/newsarticle/near-foundation-and-forkast-unveil-winners-of-women-in-web3-changemakers-2022/">Fintech Finance</a>, and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nft-double-disruption-web3-women-123000320.html">Yahoo Finance</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-digital-collective-ndc-and-phase-1-sharding-announcements">NEAR Digital Collective (NDC) and Phase 1 Sharding announcements</h2>



<p>NEAR Co-founder Illia Polosukhin gave an exclusive interview with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/12/near-protocol-forms-working-group-to-promote-defi-governance/">CoinDesk</a> about the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/near-blockchain-moves-ahead-with-phase-one-of-sharding-upgrade-1031736729">NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)</a>. This interview was syndicated in various media outlets across <a href="https://cryptotvplus.com/2022/09/nearcon-2022-near-launches-near-digital-collective-ndc/">Africa</a>, <a href="https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/near-protocol-forma-grupo-de-trabalho-para-promover-governanca-em-defi/">Brazil</a>, and <a href="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/o5w25c94.html">China</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoinDesk also covered NEAR’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/12/near-blockchain-moves-ahead-with-phase-one-of-sharding-upgrade/">Phase 1 Sharding news</a>, which made significant waves in the developer community as well as international headlines. Meanwhile, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dy4_JjcTqxhJddWQjo3qsKT3vPW7f8inGJwhYLO_K80/edit">Pagoda </a>announced their Pagoda Console—a ‘one stop’ tool shop that gives devs all the kit they need to build Web3 apps.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-hubs-launch-in-india-and-vietnam">NEAR hubs launch in India and Vietnam</h2>



<p>NEARCON also witnessed the launch of two major regional hubs—<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bfTVUW9LitXNRlD7OyT5MiMZRP75Mzj0LToeLkWdJ4/edit#heading=h.ze51feky5sjx">Vietnam</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/130LEgPu22sBiA1Q8RPviRhM9McVGvoSr6OUZiirD0Ig/edit#">India</a>.&nbsp; NEAR Foundation worked closely with the Vietnamese press to amplify the story locally, and with great success. Vietnam’s major tech titles covered the announcement, including <a href="https://zingnews.vn/near-ra-mat-trung-tam-khu-vuc-web3-tai-viet-nam-post1355031.html">Zing news</a>.</p>



<p>NEAR Foundation replicated this approach with India’s media outlets, garnering coverage in major titles such as <a href="https://yourstory.com/the-decrypting-story/near-protocol-foundation-web3-hub-india">YourStory</a>, the local equivalent of TechCrunch. Interviews were also secured with Reuters, Bloomberg and Times of India.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-stories-from-the-near-ecosystem">Other stories from the NEAR ecosystem</h2>



<p>NEAR Foundation pushed out announcements on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16FDNncIttWPeZVOgYu5cbpmG71R8Ban6/edit">Tether</a> (USDT) going live on NEAR, <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/169139/pantera-capital-leads-wallet-sender">Sender Wallet’s</a> $3.5 million funding round, and Few and Far’s ambition to grow the NEAR NFT ecosystem. There were also announcements for NEAR’s partnership with<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRRPrSfa8gHdfpiOjyRVeUfHYAX_-RaP/edit"> Fireblocks</a>, which will bring innovative crypto technologies to new global institutional investors, and <a href="https://www.altfi.com/article/9826_the-tokenomics-behind-sweatcoin">SWEAT Economy’s tokenomics</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with many of the other stories and announcements from NEARCON, these stories had mass global appeal. Coverage could be found in <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/169182/tethers-usdt-stablecoin-launches-on-near-blockchain">The Block</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-usdt-stablecoin-goes-live-on-near-protocol-to-boost-defi-presence">Cointelegraph</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/usdt-goes-live-on-near-protocol-making-it-the-14th-blockchain-network-to-support-tether/79771/1">Forbes India</a>, and&nbsp; <a href="https://cryptotvplus.com/2022/09/how-the-sweatcoin-economy-works/">CryptoTVPlus Africa</a>.</p>



<p>The sheer amount of positive press comes at a critical time for NEAR. The entire ecosystem and the wider Web3 world are building through a crypto winter but also battling other macroeconomic forces, post-Covid trauma, and climate change. It’s a time for resilience and creativity in how the NEAR and Web3 communities rethink and refashion the internet, and more importantly, the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEARCON demonstrated to the people across the globe that the protocol, ecosystem, and community will not be deterred. Builders and investors are still flocking to NEAR to build the next generation of decentralized apps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is what creating without limits looks like. And it’s just the beginning!</p>
