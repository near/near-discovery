<p>To avoid the rush of last minute transfers, and to support the inclusion of new wallets coming into the ecosystem, we are delaying the sunset of the NEAR wallet.</p>



<p>The NEAR wallet sunset is now targeted for <strong>December 31st, 2023</strong>.</p>



<p>We want to encourage users to continue to transfer their wallets using the Transfer Wizard available at wallet.near.org. Simply select “Get Started” on the banner at the top of the page displayed when you log in.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://wallet.near.org/transfer-wizard">Learn more</a> about how the Transfer Wizard works.</li>



<li>You can also <a href="https://near.org/blog/embracing-decentralization-whats-next-for-the-near-wallet">learn more</a> about why Pagoda is sunsetting the NEAR Wallet.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-the-wallet-near-org-landing-page">The future of the wallet.near.org landing page</h3>



<p>Previously, we had intended to make wallet.near.org into a wallet-centric landing page as a place for ecosystem users to learn about all the amazing wallets available on the NEAR platform. However, due to resource and time constraints, we no longer believe we could provide the best experience. Instead, we are asking the community to create an information site that showcases all the NEAR wallets.</p>



<p>These plans are still in progress as we work with community partners. More to follow when we have more to share.</p>



<p>Thank you for your continued support and patience as we work hard to improve the user onboarding and transaction experience.</p>
