<p>NEAR is a home to a number of amazing apps and projects. These developers, founders, and entrepreneurs are using NEAR to effortlessly create and distribute innovative decentralized apps, while helping build a more open web — free from centralized platforms. </p>



<p>To showcase some of the innovative products launching on NEAR, the Case Studies content vertical is making a return. With its new multimedia makeover, Case Studies will demonstrate how these projects are leveraging the power of NEAR’s layer 1 protocol and the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) to distribute their apps and onboard the masses into the open web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new NEAR Case Studies series kicks off with a video featuring Pagoda’s Chief Product Officer Alex Chiocchi. For much of the last year Alex has been deeply embedded in the development and launch of the BOS — an OS for an Open Web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the BOS Case Study video, Alex explains how the BOS takes advantage of the NEAR Protocol’s scaling architecture, while allowing builders to code in languages they already know, like Javascript. As you’ll learn from Alex, the BOS makes it easy to use the tools you already know to build apps that engage users, while fostering an open web free from centralized platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more Case Study videos on NEAR, the Blockchain Operating System for an open web.</p>
