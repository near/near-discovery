<p><a href="https://cosmose.ai/web3">Cosmose AI</a>, the global platform that uses AI to predict and influence how people shop offline is launching a new piece of technology designed to disrupt the smartphone lock screen experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Called KAIKAINOW, it brings together artificial intelligence and blockchain to help users stay informed and engaged with the world around them without the hassle of unlocking their phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW, an opt-in technology, sits on a user&#8217;s home screen. It offers a variety of curated content, including news, language learning, games, and trending stories which would be interspersed between users’ very own personal wallpaper pictures.</p>



<p>“We check our smartphone lock screens on average 80 times a day, always seeing the same&nbsp; wallpaper backdrop. Imagine, instead of seeing the same image over and over again you see it every other time, while enjoying personalized content during remaining interactions,” says Miron Mironiuk, Founder and CEO of Cosmose AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KAIKAINOW changes that by harnessing cutting edge AI technology, and pairing it with open web tools found on the NEAR blockchain to ensure the experience is tailored to the user while always adhering to the highest privacy standards.</p>



<p>“The launch of KAIKAINOW by COSMOSE AI shows how far we’ve come in respects to transforming Web3 from an innovative idea to a something that can deliver real world benefits to consumers, while also helping foster brand loyalty and business growth in the retail space,” says Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to align ourselves with such a fantastic, rapidly growing tech firm such as Cosmose AI and look forward to seeing how it will truly transform the world of retail and get the world closer to Web3 mass adoption.”</p>



<p> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blockchain-meets-ai">Blockchain meets AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Publishers and brands provide the content and KAIKAINOW enhances the experience by allowing users to unlock rewards via KAI-CHING, a native token pegged to the US Dollar built on the NEAR Protocol. These tokens can then be used to access exclusive offers only available to KAIKAINOW users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to KAI-CHING, shoppers and retailers benefit from shorter payment processing time and significantly lower fees.</p>



<p>By building both consumer products and its token on NEAR protocol, Cosmose AI is accelerating its Web3 offerings with one of the world’s leading, open source blockchain platforms and further advancing the AI-driven retail ecosystem.</p>



<p>To date, Cosmose AI has served over 20 million stores and reached one billion phones globally. The integration of NEAR technologies means that Cosmose can ensure that users maintain complete control over their data and benefit from the ecosystem they help create. This approach ensures the highest level of privacy for users and aligns with the Company&#8217;s commitment to user safety.</p>



<p>Blockchain’s digital record, paired with NEAR’s open web tooling, means AI services can help improve trust in data integrity and, by extension, in the recommendations that AI provides. Using blockchain to store and distribute AI models provides an audit trail, and pairing blockchain and AI can enhance data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR is helping partners like Cosmose AI harness these tools to create better products that serve customers and partners equally.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Artificial Intelligence (AI) wave is touching just about every corner of commerce and culture, and retail is no exception. <a href="https://cosmose.co/">Cosmose AI</a>, one of the leaders in AI and retail, has received a strategic investment from NEAR Foundation to create Web3, mobile, and retail experiences that enhance personalization without sacrificing privacy or security.</p>



<p>“NEAR is the most secure, scalable, and sustainable blockchain protocol,” says Miron Mironiuk, founder and CEO of Cosmose. “As such, we’re grateful for the ongoing support from NEAR Foundation and are excited about what’s to come.”</p>



<p>By utilizing the NEAR Blockchain Operating System (BOS) and AI-powered retail personalization, Cosmose gives users access to their data and personalized recommendations. This move toward a decentralized and user-focused Web3 future emphasizes how AI and blockchain have the power to completely alter current business structures in the retail sector.</p>



<p>With the help of NEAR’s technology and ecosystem, Cosmose can now change conventional retail business models and produce hyper-personalized shopping experiences that increase loyalty and happiness. These experiences will include its flagship mobile application <a href="https://kaikai.ai/">KaiKai</a> and a suite of AI-powered personalization tools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-personalizing-retail-with-web3-experiences">Personalizing retail with Web3 experiences</h2>



<p>Shopper and user personalization is nothing new in retail, but Cosmose is blazing a new trail with the power of its proprietary AI engine. Cosmose’s AI gathers and analyzes user data to produce suggestions and experiences that are uniquely tailored to each user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By building on NEAR, Cosmose is able to help retailers develop stronger customer interactions while also addressing privacy and data security issues endemic to Web2 retail data collection. Cosmose and its KaiKai mobile app are trusted by top brands including LVMH, Richemont, L’Oréal, and Estée Lauder.</p>



<p>“Having built on NEAR in 2022 and while working with NEAR Foundation we discovered that our visions for the Web3-driven future are aligned,” Mironiuk continues.</p>



<p>Through the partnership, Cosmose will be able to offer individualized experiences to its worldwide clientele through a number of channels, including online, in-store, and mobile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This investment from NEAR Foundation is a testament to Cosmose AI&#8217;s strength and potential to revolutionize e-commerce and the retail industry,&#8221; said George Raymond Zage III, founder and CEO of Tiga Investments and a Cosmose board member. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to see Cosmose AI&#8217;s continued growth and success.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kaikai-introducing-shoppertainment-on-the-near-blockchain-operating-system">KaiKai: Introducing “Shoppertainment” on the NEAR Blockchain Operating System</h2>



<p>KaiKai, Cosmose AI&#8217;s flagship product, shopping, retail, and gamification to create a new category altogether: Shoppertainment. The mobile shopping experience is constructed in a very unique way, using the BOS as a backbone to make brand discovery and engagement more fun and rewarding.</p>



<p>Some of KaiKai’s features that brands are already using include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Exclusive product drops available for a limited time</li>



<li>Augmented Reality (AR) technology that brings products to life</li>



<li>Livestreams featuring celebrities and influencers</li>



<li>Ads displayed on users&#8217; lock screens without interruptions</li>



<li>Geolocation features displaying available products in the user&#8217;s area</li>



<li>Rewards for collecting products and writing reviews</li>



<li>A secure Near wallet accessible via the KaiKai app</li>
</ul>



<p>KaiKai also features a native cryptocurrency called Kai-Ching, which users earn and spend like any other retail rewards program. The difference is that Cosmose’s AI provides more personalized recommendations and rewards suggestions, with customers easily transacting on the NEAR blockchain with a native KaiKai crypto wallet.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to support Cosmose as it continues to scale rapidly and create new ways for retailers to offer customers the best offline and online shopping experiences,” noted Marieke Flament, CEO of the NEAR Foundation. “Cosmose has already been building on NEAR testnet, and with this additional support it will have many more opportunities to grow and expand its offerings with Web3 in a sustainable, transparent, and infinitely scalable way.” </p>



<p>Flament added: “Cosmose’s excellent AI innovation will help to intensify its global marketplace lead, and with superior AI-driven personalization, its user base will undoubtedly continue to grow as new and existing customers are seamlessly transitioned into the world of Web3 and all the exciting opportunities it brings.”</p>



<p>It’s no secret that AI is turning industries, communities, and business models on their heads – and that’s not a bad thing. NEAR Foundation’s commitment to developing Cosmose’s retail technology, including KaiKai, signals that consumers will now be even more empowered with more personal recommendations, a “shoppertaining” experience, and the sound of “Kai-Ching” as they earn crypto rewards powered by NEAR and BOS.</p>



<p>“Together we’ll build a future where one billion users benefit from the ecosystem they’re part of, with complete control of their data and superior AI-driven personalization,” said Mironiuk.</p>
