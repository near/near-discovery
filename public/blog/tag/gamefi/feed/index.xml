<p>The Near Foundation is excited to announce that it’s partnering with WEMADE, one of the largest publicly-listed gaming companies in South Korea. A leading game developer in South Korea for over 20 years, WEMADE will be vital in Near’s push toward mainstream adoption of Web3.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>&#8220;WEMADE and Near share a similar vision of enabling and accelerating the mainstream adoption of blockchain to create a future of nearly limitless potential use cases and benefits for all of us across many different areas of our daily lives,” said Shane Kim, CEO, WEMIX and Vice President, WEMADE.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Near is excited to announce a new strategic partnership with BORA, a Web3&nbsp; gaming subsidiary of METABORA. Near and BORA will support each other in spreading local brand awareness, invest in research and collaboration on cross-chain, host events, and generate Web3 opportunities in Korea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An affiliate of Kakao Games and its parent company BORANETWORK, BORA is focused on game development and blockchain-based gaming ecosystems. Its mobile gaming titles include <em>Friends Popcorn</em>, <em>Friends Town</em>, and <em>Friends Shot</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with Near and welcome their expertise, knowledge and network as we aim to transform the world of Web3 gaming,” said Vincent Lim, a CBO of BORA. “Together with Near we will not only explore cross-promotion opportunities, but also seek future collaborations on IP-based game development that will lead to mass adoption and give us the competitive edge we need to position ourselves as leading players in the web3 gaming space.”</p>



<p>Since the launch of Near’s Korean Hub in November of 2022, BORA has been steadily building up awareness throughout South Korea, while focusing on Web3&nbsp; innovation, business development, education, and talent. The hub is led by entrepreneurs Scott Lee and Ben Kang — both influential figures within South Korea’s growing blockchain community.</p>



<p>“One of the big ambitions of the hub&nbsp; is&nbsp; to tap into the country’s active gaming community, and to&nbsp; bring&nbsp; amazing projects and creators to the Near ecosystem.” said Robbie Lim, GM, Partners &amp; International at Near. “ The partnership with BORA is our first major win &#8211; and a big step forward for NEAR as it accelerates its ambition to become the go to layer 1 for the Web3 gaming community.”&nbsp;</p>
