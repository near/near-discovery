<p><em>NEAR is a home to a number of amazing apps and projects. These developers, founders, and entrepreneurs are using NEAR to effortlessly create and distribute innovative decentralized apps, while helping build a more open web — free from centralized platforms. In these Case Study videos, NEAR Foundation showcases some of these projects.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the latest NEAR Foundation Case Study video, viewers hear from Laura Cunningham, Team Lead at NEAR Horizon and General Manager at NEAR Foundation. NEAR Horizon is a Web3 accelerator program revolutionizing how founders and builders receive support in the open web. Laura takes viewers on a deep dive into Horizon’s startup accelerator marketplace, which the Horizon team built on the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). </p>



<p>“The BOS was our platform of choice for building NEAR Horizon because it makes Horizon much more accessible to founders and projects that are already in the ecosystem. And then ones coming in new, you can be building on another chain as long as you have some component of your stack on NEAR then you can apply and be part of NEAR Horizon,  ” she adds. “It is also incredibly composable, so we were able to fork different attributes that were already available on BOS and make use of them in our front end, so it made it a lot quicker to actually develop.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Web3 builders, developers, and founders are gearing up to join the<a href="https://www.encode.club/encode-near-horizon-bootcamp"> Encode x NEAR Horizon Bootcamp</a> starting July 10th, 2023 to upgrade their building, development, and coding skills. Following the <a href="/blog/near-horizon-and-encode-club-accelerating-blockchain-mastery-for-builders/?_gl=1%2A11sk0z6%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2AODI2MzI2NzAxLjE2ODY1NjEwMzM.%2A_ga_9GWCXQJ62J%2AMTY4NjU2MTAzMC4xLjEuMTY4NjU2MTEwMS4wLjAuMA..">recent partnership</a> between NEAR Horizon and Encode Club, the bootcamp is part of a broader initiative to accelerate blockchain expertise with a focus on developing Rust smart contracts.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.encode.club/">Encode Club</a> is a community that helps builders grow their technical capabilities with tangible results, such as completing projects, promoting employability, and gaining funding. This mission aligns seamlessly with <a href="https://shortlink.near.foundation/nearhorizon">NEAR Horizon</a>, a new branch of the NEAR Foundation fostering innovation and development among early stage Web3 Founders building in the NEAR ecosystem</p>



<p>If you’re a self-starting developer hungry to learn more about building on NEAR, then the NEAR x Encode Club Bootcamp might just be the perfect crash course to get started and progress rapidly. Apply here for the NEAR x Encode Bootcamp. Here’s the lowdown on what the bootcamp will entail and how NEAR builders can fast track their Web3 skillset and knowledge base to the next level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ranking-up-in-web3-with-the-near-x-encode-club-bootcamp">Ranking up in Web3 with the NEAR x Encode Club Bootcamp</h2>



<p>Firstly, selected participants can attend the bootcamp for free, reflecting Encode Club’s commitment to supporting Web3 builders. The 90-minute lessons will be conducted via Zoom (or similar), Monday through Thursday over the course of eight weeks, and feature an engaging mix of deep educational content focused on smart contract development as well as hands-on learning from Encode Club technical experts.</p>



<p>Mentors will guide participants through a variety of topics and related subjects, demystifying&nbsp; the myriad of concepts and nuances inherent in blockchain development. The focus will be primarily on the NEAR ecosystem, with the goal of ensuring that everyone gains the practical skills and knowledge to excel, succeed, and create in the rapidly evolving Web3 world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calling-all-coders-bootcamp-application-and-selection-process">Calling all coders: Bootcamp application and selection process</h2>



<p>There are no official prerequisites to applying for the bootcamp. However, previous coding and Web3 or blockchain experience (particularly with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">RUST</a>) will help you get the most from the sessions. The Bootcamp is also part-time, giving attendees flexibility with their full-time commitments.</p>



<p>After registration, the pool will be whittled down to a shortlist who will be asked to conduct a brief interview before being formally selected and invited to attend. At this time, selectees will be asked to provide a small deposit, repaid when the Bootcamp concludes. The cohort size will be roughly 50 people, with Encode Club assisting in job placement once finished.</p>



<p>The NEAR x Encode Club Bootcamp is a perfect example of the work NEAR Horizon is doing as a startup support platform for the entire ecosystem. Any builders, developers, or NEAR blockchain enthusiasts should <a href="https://www.encode.club/encode-near-horizon-bootcamp">apply directly</a> through Encode Club right away, as cohort space is currently limited. To learn more about NEAR Horizon or to list your project on the Horizon platform, visit <a href="https://shortlink.near.foundation/nearhorizon">near.org/horizon</a>.</p>



<p>Your mission – should you choose to accept and sign the transaction – is to master Web3 at the NEAR x Encode Club Bootcamp. <a href="https://www.encode.club/encode-near-horizon-bootcamp">Apply now</a> and report for duty on July 10th!</p>

<p>NEAR has a monolithic mega-booth at Consensus 2023, where there have been a number of awesome NEAR announcements, talks, and events, including the big news out: the <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-announces-the-blockchain-operating-system/">Blockchain Operating System</a> is now live on Near.org and the NEAR Horizon accelerator is open for business. If you haven&#8217;t stopped by yet to meet our NEAR experts or are unable to attend, we’ve got you covered with all of the highlights. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at everything NEAR at Consensus, including the BOS, NEAR Horizon, a submissions call for the latest edition of Women in Web3, and much more!&nbsp;And stay tuned for more NEAR at Consensus highlights over the next few days. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bos-is-now-live-on-near-org">The BOS is now live on Near.org</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mailchain brings encrypted communication to NEAR-based dApps</h3>



<p>Mailchain, an open source, multi-chain communication layer for Web3, announced integration with NEAR. Now, NEAR developers can send encrypted messages between blockchain wallet addresses with simple, unified inbox to view and send messages and keep track of on-chain activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR’s vision has always been to onboard the next billion users to the Open Web. With Mailchain, these next billion users can communicate natively with one another, regardless of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mailchain’s integration with NEAR is a significant step towards strengthening the interoperability mission of NEAR&#8217;s blockchain operating system (BOS). NEAR’s BOS and Mailchain are both chain-agnostic, prioritize usability and security, and together make Web3 more accessible and interoperable for users.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our vision aligns perfectly with NEAR’s&#8211;to onboard the next billion users,&#8221; said Tim Boeckmann, CEO of Mailchain. &#8220;When building Mailchain, we knew these next billion users would want to communicate with what mattered most to them, their blockchain identities. Mailchain&#8217;s secure communication protocol makes this a reality. We believe that this integration is a big step forwards for the developers who are building the next generation of the Internet.&#8221;</p>
