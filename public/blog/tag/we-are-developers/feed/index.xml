<p>Additionally, the &#8220;Tekuno Activation: Devs Without Limits&#8221; is adding an exciting gamified element to the conference, running throughout both days (more on this below). Attendees are encouraged to collect PODs at the NEAR booth, as well as during both BOS sessions, culminating in the exclusive &#8220;We Are Devs&#8221; POD and a shot at winning a ticket to NEARCON 2023.</p>
