										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most of today’s dapps are not actually dapps, i.e. <em>decentralized applications. </em>If you need to leave the app in order to start using it, it’s not really an app––it’s just a frontend. If users have to manually onboard themselves through exchanges and manage multiple accounts and gas fees and bridges, did you even build an app? I think not––which may explain why only a few million people in the world are using dapps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we want to see mainstream adoption of Web3 because we believe a more open, decentralized internet that supports self-sovereignty for all people is <a href="/blog/self-sovereignty-is-near-a-vision-for-our-ecosystem">better for the world</a>, then we will need to do better.</p>



<p>The prevailing narrative in Web3 today is modularity, or separating out the different functional layers of a blockchain, i.e. settlement, data availability, and execution, for the sake of scalability. Layer-twos, optimistic and ZK rollups, data availability layers, sidechains, and state channels are all examples of modularity solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This proliferation of blockchains &amp; rollups has led to a degraded experience for users and developers. Modularity and a world of many chains leads to more fragmentation of liquidity, apps, and users––a significant degree of complexity in the user experience that no mainstream user could ever be expected to navigate. This also applies to developers, who feel pressure to commit to a specific tech stack while limiting the audience for their application. Now when you build a dapp, you’re enshrining yourself into a small addressable market by choosing a single chain.</p>



<p>I want to propose a better vision for the entire Ethereum ecosystem and all of Web3: let’s work together on advancing mainstream adoption via chain abstraction. The idea is that blockchains must be abstracted away from the user so they are not barriers to entry or participation. NEAR has been focusing on this vision since 2018 and today has achieved the most users of any network in Web3: 12.4 million monthly active accounts and 34 million accounts overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how we can defragment Web3 and onboard billions of users via dapps.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What does this look like for the user?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Let’s imagine how using a dapp should actually work: transacting across networks and navigating between experiences with ease, all within a single interface. As one example, Alice picks up her phone and opens <a href="https://kaikai.ai/">KAIKAI</a> from her lockscreen. She orders a smoothie from a local place and sees in the app that there’s a discount offer from her favorite clothing store, Maison, and orders a pair of shoes for the spring. Alice sees she has earned enough KAICHING rewards to get a badge from Maison, not knowing it’s an NFT on Polygon, and redeems it in her account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she browses Maison on the KAIKAI app later that day, she notices that her new badge reveals an offer to buy tickets for an exclusive event at their store with a DJ she likes. She buys the ticket with KAICHING and receives 2 tickets, still not knowing it’s an NFT on Arbitrum. Since she gets a +1, Alice invites her friend Bob to come with her and pings him for his address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bob sends his NEAR address to Alice and opens his app to check out the ticket. He sends Alice some ETH to say thanks for the invite and looks at the different cryptos he has in his account. Since he’s on the metro and has some time, he decides to buy some BTC and borrow against it with USDC so he can mint a Fighting Dragon NFT on Magic Eden. His friend Charles texted him earlier to get one so they could play each other in Year of the Dragon, a new game on NEAR where their dragons can battle each other for coins they can stake.</p>



<p>All of these interactions and transactions can take place in a single interface and in a completely private way. There are no wallets, no switching networks, and no transaction fees to deal with; those are embedded directly in the swap or the buy and handled on behalf of the user. Alice didn’t need to worry about which network the ticket is on and Bob can send her funds for the ticket in whichever crypto he wants, moving seamlessly into buying a different one the next second. All inside of an app. This is the level of seamlessness we should be striving for as an ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>How do we achieve Chain Abstraction?</strong></p>



<p>Everyone building an app in Web3 will benefit from being able to access such a broad market of potential users as in this example––i.e. anyone who uses apps. Whereas today, developers choose a network based on access to liquidity or the users of a specific rollup or chain, in a chain abstraction future they can just build with the best tech. The users will show up for the best experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine if a Gmail user couldn’t just send a message to an Outlook address––it doesn’t make sense. The same is true for Web3 addresses. The core assumption of chain abstraction is: end users don’t care about the underlying blockchain. They just want apps to work. In reality, blockchains are simply infrastructure to receive value out of Web3: security of assets from seizure, economic opportunity, removing middlemen for transactions, global permissionless identity, data provenance, entertaining experiences, and more.</p>



<p>The core goal of chain abstraction is to defragment the increasingly fractured modular landscape of Web3. While this will be most visible at the user experience layer, this defragmentation of liquidity and accounts is possible thanks to innovation at the security layer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zero knowledge (ZK) introduces a principally new approach to ledger security. Whereas before one needed to trust a decentralized set of validators, now even a single computer can prove that rules were followed with a simple proof. This means that where before, developers would be forced to either build on a shared chain or spend immense resources to launch a new one, now they can just spin one up on their single server.</p>



<p>This new paradigm introduces the idea of cross settlement: as more chains become fully ZK provable, if some proof is published on other chains, there is no way to revert this chain without also needing to revert other chains. Transactions from one chain can also settle on multiple others via ZK proofs. This provides mesh security as all proofs continuously get aggregated, allowing the safe movement of assets between such chains.</p>



<p>In order to achieve unified security, two things are needed at the bottom of the stack: Data availability, which provides a way for everyone to sync even if the operator is offline, and a decentralized sequencer for applications that don’t have a central operator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next layer is identity with that security unified. Users can have an address on all possible chains and move assets between them freely. From a user perspective, this should be a single account where they interact with apps on different chains, and assets either get bridged or swapped automatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I call this “account aggregation” and will share more details about it in another post soon. NEAR will launch the next version of FastAuth in March 2024, which has mapping for NEAR addresses to EVM, Bitcoin, and other addresses. NEAR accounts can request to sign a transaction for another chain. This allows them to build multichain apps directly as smart contracts on NEAR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The final layer is unifying the experience layer, or the application layer (e.g. <a href="https://alpha.dapdap.net/">DapDap</a>)––providing a way to interact with apps on various chains without users switching or needing to leave a single interface. A decentralized frontend can provide easy components to build in a chain-abstracted way. NEAR can achieve this through NearJS, combining data indexing and decentralized frontends––V2 also coming in March 2024. </p>



<p><strong>How is NEAR enabling Chain Abstraction?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The NEAR ecosystem has been building towards the chain abstraction vision since its beginnings in 2018, focusing on usability, a flexible account model, and a highly scalable blockchain that could support mainstream apps with billions of users. Today, the stack has expanded to support full chain abstraction across chains and all kinds of apps.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Scalable, integrated blockchain that can grow to 1B+ daily active accounts.</li>



<li>Security aggregation stack consisting of <a href="https://near.org/data-availability">NEAR DA</a>, <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/polygon-developers-zk-proofs">zkWASM</a> (collaboration with Polygon Labs), and <a href="https://near.org/blog/near-foundation-and-eigen-labs-partner-to-enable-faster-cheaper-web3-transactions-for-ethereum-rollups-via-eigenlayer/">EigenLayer-powered Fast Finality</a>.</li>



<li>Account aggregation on top of this to enable transacting on all chains using a single account</li>



<li>Data layer that supports everything from monolithic, integrated, modular, private and permissioned chains to query data in a <a href="https://docs.near.org/bos/queryapi/intro">predictable protocol</a>.</li>



<li>Intent relayers that can execute complex intents across chains using this infra.</li>



<li><a href="https://docs.near.org/bos/overview">Decentralized frontends</a> that provide discoverability and composability for multiple apps across chains into one experience.</li>



<li>Super (app) wallets that are user friendly and offer a way to navigate all of Web3 without having to switch networks or deal with gas tokens and bridges.</li>
</ul>



<p>Importantly, each of these layers supports builders from across Web3, including Ethereum, rollups &amp; L2s, and beyond––the multichain future is becoming the chain abstraction future.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>



<p>2024 is the year of hiding the complexity of multichain infrastructure to deliver the Web3 experiences we’re striving for. Improving usability and discoverability should be a priority for all Web3 builders, as well as solving for liquidity fragmentation and security tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s make chain abstraction a movement. The NEAR ecosystem invites builders from across Web3 to take advantage of the solutions we’re offering and to collaborate with us to build more chain abstraction solutions together. Stay tuned for more news on collaborations as well as details on an exciting event that NEAR Foundation will co-host at ETHDenver 2024.<br><br><em>Special thanks to Zaki Manian for conversations that led to this post as well as for his review.</em></p>

<p>It was an incredible first-ever <a href="https://nearapac.org/">NEAR APAC</a>, with the NEAR ecosystem scootering through Saigon over the last two days. Vietnam served as the perfect backdrop for NEAR’s inaugural showcase in Asia-Pacific, with community members, B.O.S. builders, and general Web3 enthusiasts coming together in one of the region&#8217;s most dynamic countries.</p>



<p>The event was spearheaded by the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam Hub</a> with support from the NEAR Foundation, exemplifying strong commitment and collaboration between local and global ecosystem stakeholders.&nbsp; ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<p>ICYMI, here are some of the biggest sessions, announcements, and events from NEAR APAC 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-s-bright-investment-outlook-in-asia-pacific">Web3’s bright investment outlook in Asia-Pacific</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20876" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0065-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the most encouraging and optimistic sessions was moderated by NEAR’s Head of Finance, David Norris, focusing on the current and future outlook of blockchain investment and development in the region. David was joined by Web3 venture veterans Riccardo Pagano from <a href="https://outlierventures.io/">Outlier Ventures</a> and Whiplus Wang of <a href="https://www.ivcrypto.io/">IVC crypto</a>.</p>



<p>The trio dove into the current state of blockchain investment in APAC, and how Web3 might just ascend to becoming one of the most invested sectors in the region from a venture and infrastructure perspective. Ricardo in particular emphasized that he’s seeing a shift in perception from investors, with Web3 going from a niche technology to its own broad-based sector.</p>



<p>“Even though we’re technically in a bear market, investment in Web3 sub-sectors like gaming is still strong,” added Whiplus. “Games like<em> Angry Birds </em>and <em>Fruit Ninja</em> were instrumental in onboarding Web2 users onto the smartphone, for example. That’s why investment into blockchain game publishers is increasing — to find that killer game that onboards billions.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20874" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0058-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Whiplus also likened successful blockchain startups to a bowl of Pho, with a blend of technical and business elements being integral to a delicious final dish. The panel also touched on technical nuances like ZK rollups and modular blockchains, emphasizing the need to invest in talent and innovation through initiatives like hackathons.</p>



<p>The session encapsulated a forward-looking perspective on Web3&#8217;s trajectory. With the bar for founder participation evidently rising, the panel stressed the importance of education in the space. There was unanimous optimism about Southeast Asia&#8217;s digital future as potentially outpacing even established tech hubs like Korea and Japan.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-supports-b-o-s-and-blockchain-builders-in-apac">NEAR supports B.O.S. and blockchain builders in APAC</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20871" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_0011-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Tons of activity also took place in and around the Builder Stage, with the NEAR Foundation and local blockchain organizations teaming up to educate and assist developers, builders, and job seekers in advancing themselves into Web3. Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, led a panel on the stage informing developers on how to upskill from Web2 to Web3.</p>



<p>Local developer advocates from notable projects like the Graph and Khyber network also participated in sessions, workshops, and panels on the Builder Stage designed to upskill local blockchain professionals. There was something for everyone, from a job fair for Web3 newbies to a Greenhouse area connecting founders and projects to VCs for funding.</p>



<p>Exploring everything from dApp architecture to tokenomics, the Builder Stage action was highlighted by an incredible Hackathon, with participants receiving guidance from experts like Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweateconomy.com/">SWEAT</a>. On the final night of the festivities, NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin presented awards to the winners on stage in front of a packed main hall.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pagoda-takes-the-main-stage-to-talk-user-adoption-and-fastauth">Pagoda takes the main stage to talk user adoption and FastAuth</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20873" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/QUR_9815-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, the CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, showcased FastAuth during his session titled &#8220;Unlocking the Power of B.O.S: Product Update for Founders &amp; Developers.&#8221; FastAuth aims to redefine the user experience for developers and founders, addressing the longstanding challenges of both onboarding and retaining new Web3 users.</p>



<p>A primary takeaway was how FastAuth’s next release will minimize gas fees when onboarding, thus removing barriers for end-users. The introduction of multiparty compute (MPC) allows proofs from various organizations to be combined, simplifying processes like email recovery. Chiocchi emphasized the potential for users to migrate effortlessly from Web2 logins, hinting at a seamless integration between the two web generations.</p>



<p>Discussing the nuances of retaining users in Web3, Chiocchi stressed that coin incentives alone aren&#8217;t sufficient. The &#8220;toothbrush test&#8221; was highlighted, illustrating that many apps don&#8217;t become daily necessities for users. Trust plays a pivotal role, especially with the rise of scams in the decentralized space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-side-events-and-after-parties-storm-the-streets-of-saigon">Side events and after-parties storm the streets of Saigon</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20872" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0824-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>NEAR APAC fully embraced the “work hard, play hard” ethos of Vietnam and Asia-Pacific. Even during the event, there were LED dancers, Manga Cosplay, and several massive DJs and party breaks. Not to mention the NEAR APAC Opening Night party at the Intercontinental Hotel, where Illia officially welcomed attendees and kicked things off in an intimate setting.</p>



<p>And in one of the coolest side events in recent NEAR memory, Dap Dap showcased its platform to B.O.S. enthusiasts at the My House meeting venue nestled in one of Saigon’s many cozily-lit alleyways. Dap Dap is the first commercial B.O.S. product and will act as a gateway to hundreds of chains and protocols for users from a single, user-friendly interface.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="681" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-20875" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1024x681.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MIH_0845-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>B.O.S Beats by <a href="https://www.daorecords.org/">DAO Records</a> was the grand finale of NEAR APAC, offering a vibrant blend of hip-hop beats from prominent DJs on the decentralized record label. Held at Indika Saigon — and with pizza supplied by Pizza DAO — attendees enjoyed live performances, refreshments, and networking opportunities with the global and APAC NEAR communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR APAC was an incredible Web3 Bánh Mì, layering an eclectic mix of speakers, insights, and events to create something completely unique. The NEAR Foundation would like to thank every cook in the kitchen, especially local partners like the NEAR Vietnam Hub who made sure that the first ever NEAR APAC had the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy.</p>

<p>Let’s begin the Day Two recap with a standout panel diving into the next big Web3 trends. Experts agreed that it won’t just be about technological progress, but also the transformative ways that blockchain will weave into daily life. Asset tokenization, generative AI integration, and the proliferation of decentralized creator economies were some top trends on the table.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RgVgqs1g0x-gnx5Kvaa6mVPfaIXaZxyV1m_WAE0Ce6zUb-OKD6-LI066PiE1II_S3T9bDYSHDGyGVyG5Np03ekD10YSpe6r5bbN36500oObHLrOGuQD3Q2W_po-e_vF-tBOVuvLoBIHvgM0lZiJPI5I" alt=""/></figure>



<p>“Generative AI and asset tokenization are revolutionizing Web3 ecosystems, especially in growing economies like India,” said Sudeep Choudhari, head of blockchain at the <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/">India National Payments Corporation</a>. “As integration across borders accelerates, we’ll also challenge traditional FX rates, anticipating a future with minimal cross-border payment costs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hanna Tantoco, APAC Marketing Director at <a href="https://www.blockdaemon.com/">Blockdaemon</a>, piggybacked on the transformative role of generative AI in enhancing blockchain user experiences. She also pointed out the rising prominence of gaming in Asia, particularly on NEAR. Additionally, she highlighted Singapore&#8217;s burgeoning creator economy, powered largely by NFTs, as another future trend.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brands-can-futureproof-themselves-with-blockchain">How brands can futureproof themselves with blockchain</h2>



<p>Another morning highlight was a panel discussion about how brands and enterprises can harness the potential of Web3 to adapt and thrive. Key points revolved around democratizing user data control, countering data monopolization by tech giants, tokenizing assets, and challenges in linking the physical and digital worlds.</p>



<p>“Enterprises often face challenges with hiring experts who may quickly move on to other projects,” observed Oleg Fomenko, founder of <a href="https://sweatco.in/">SWEAT</a>. “While consultancies can provide insights, the real breakthrough comes when you start building and experimenting with MVPs. Though initial attempts might fall short, perseverance can yield surprising results.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Sd5LLo5KtoZlpO890p-2gemKPglzS_SZ4oWvR0pbA9WS1QOKwX-KJJCRBvObEAfU2shd5zUxumyCybxoyQT6OLdB_TbzLsOY6X-xrcfjVbRwp3UzXdhEFaVVk1sCFuO3x0PIQJ2xxlqQdk9SjCmrKVw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Alex Chiocchi, CPO of <a href="https://www.pagoda.co/">Pagoda</a>, added that Web3 streamlines verification, challenging traditional ad networks. By using an open blockchain system, excessive fees are prevented, promoting shared value with users. This shift allows benefits like self-custody and reputation while redistributing margins back to the people.</p>



<p>Among the key takeaways from the session was that businesses harnessing blockchain&#8217;s capabilities can anticipate a transformative impact on the global economy, especially with asset tokenization&#8217;s projected growth through 2030. As brands navigate challenges like ensuring digital authenticity and early adoption, having a targeted strategy is crucial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-web3-gaming-asia-s-landscape-and-blockchain-utilization">Web3 gaming: Asia&#8217;s landscape and blockchain utilization</h2>



<p>The Asian gaming landscape is buzzing with the rise of Web3 development, promising an unprecedented era of innovation and user empowerment. Central to discussions at the &#8220;Web3 Gaming: Asia Landscape&#8221; session was the gaming community&#8217;s appetite for asset and data ownership, often prioritizing this over the complexities of Web3 itself.</p>



<p>After attending Korea Blockchain Week, it&#8217;s evident that Japan and Korea&#8217;s mobile giants are pioneering in Web3 gaming,” said Luke Xie, founder of gaming VC fund <a href="https://pressstart.capital/">Press Start Capital</a>. “As opposed to Web3 games like Axie, creating AAA games takes much longer. Given the rapid pace of crypto, former mobile developers align better with this fast-paced dynamic.”</p>



<p>Ishank Gupta, co-founder of <a href="https://www.kratosstudios.io/">Kratos Studios</a> in India, emphasized that gamers prioritize asset and data ownership over backend Web3 tech. He predicted that blockchain games should bring benefits that gamers care about with a focus on ease of usability. For instance, leading studios in India are integrating well-known IP into Web3 games while ensuring they remain engaging.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re witnessing a new golden age of gaming driven by indie studios,” added Xie. “Small teams, empowered by AI, are crafting games that punch above their weight. We believe that on-chain gaming, while difficult to execute at present, is the future. It’s all about selecting the right chain based on tech, community, and support. NEAR excels at all of the above.”</p>



<p>The panel agreed that the Web3 gaming industry in APAC and beyond is undergoing a transformative phase, with blockchain offering gamers more control over assets and data. As developers continue to build, the focus will be on seamless onboarding, speed, and user-centric experiences. Blockchains should be subtly integrated without disrupting the gaming experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bringing-web3-together-with-multichain-a-call-for-collaboration">Bringing Web3 together with Multichain: a call for collaboration&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Today’s blockchain landscape consists of independent Layer 1’s vying for supremacy, bringing up the core question of interoperability. With users often navigating several ecosystems, creating cross-chain experiences becomes paramount. This star-studded panel explored new frameworks to address hurdles and challenges in the current siloed multi-chain user experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-1024x768.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-20842" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-300x225.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-10-21.14.09.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>“Web3&#8217;s ethos is modularity, similar to Lego blocks,” explained NEAR CEO Marike Flament. “While we prioritize access and user growth, interoperability challenges persist. But trust and unified solutions drive adoption, not a fractured approach. It&#8217;s essential that technology seamlessly serves the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron Dennis, CEO of <a href="https://www.banyan.gg/">Banyan</a>, added that key management is a critical issue. He pointed out ways to simplify these processes with tools like <a href="https://wiki.near.org/overview/BOS/fast-auth">FastAuth</a>. Dennis added that addressing the noticeable gap in cross-chain liquidity should be a focus. He believes that a true multichain future that drives adoption will solve key and wallet management for a better UX.</p>



<p>“Reflecting on a decade in this space, the competitive landscape has shifted,” mused Mary Beth Buchanan from the Cardano Foundation who is also an advisor to NEAR, “Earlier, exchanges hesitated to collaborate, fearing a loss of advantage. Today, there&#8217;s a collective push to learn from one another, ensuring technology works seamlessly for the end user.”</p>



<p>Cameron believes that reinforcing the current ecosystem is paramount before extending cross-chain efforts, even though creating a decentralized internet remains a resource-intensive endeavor.</p>



<p>Marieke stressed the importance of open-source technology in attracting top talent. Drawing inspiration from Web2&#8217;s approach to 5G standardization, she suggested that Layer 1 leaders could unite in an &#8216;L20&#8217; alliance to champion unified standards, fostering a unified vision for the industry&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>And that’s a wrap for the official Day 2 sessions at NEAR APAC. From gaming and brand adoption to multi-chain standards and collaboration, it was clear that this first-of-its-kind regional event was a rousing success for developers and the NEAR community alike. Sunday in Saigon rolls on with more side events and after-parties, so stay tuned for the full ICYMI tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After many months in the making, the inaugural NEAR APAC conference kicked off today in Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam. Held in conjunction with the <a href="https://nearvietnamhub.org/">NEAR Vietnam community</a> and NEAR Foundation, NEAR APAC is showcasing the vibrant crypto and Web3 community across the region as well as the potential of the B.O.S. and Open Web both locally and globally.</p>



<p>The day was charged with excitement, drawing over 8,000 attendees from various corners of the APAC region and beyond. With Web3 thought leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts converging in Vietnam, Day One of NEAR APAC kicked off with a slew of riveting discussions, industry insights, and speculations on the future of the Open Web with a focus on APAC.</p>



<p>From discussions around regional growth and investment potential to how AI and blockchain will transform the future of work, here’s everything that went down at an incredible start to NEAR APAC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-setting-the-stage-for-near-apac-with-vietnam-in-focus">Setting the stage for NEAR APAC with Vietnam in focus</h2>



<p>The event kicked off with a focus on southeast Asia, with NEAR’s Vietnam country director Riley Tran welcoming attendees and providing context as to Asia’s critical role in the overarching development and expansion of Web3. Tran was followed by two NEAR luminaries, CEO Marieke Flament and co-founder Illia Polosukhin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Asia&#8217;s young demographics and rapid digital growth, especially in Vietnam, position it as a leader in crypto and blockchain growth,” Riley explained. “With over 100 million new internet users in just three years, Asia&#8217;s momentum in Web3 is accelerating”</p>



<p>Marieke added that the overall NEAR ecosystem remains strong with over 29M active wallets and 650K daily active accounts. She added that a collaborative approach to building tomorrow’s Open Web is critical for tackling significant societal and digital challenges.<br><br>&#8220;Today’s Web 2.0 is closed and siloed, with the prevailing digital culture being a toxic dialectic,&#8221; Marieke expressed. “But the value loop of an Open Web holds immense promise. We’re already seeing how projects like KaiKai, SWEAT, and PlayEmber can move the needle in the right direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Echoing Mariek’s sentiment, Illia emphasized that it’s not necessarily about championing a specific blockchain, but about creating a common layer and interface for the Open Web. This is precisely what the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) is in the process of achieving.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looking forward, tech isn&#8217;t the only focus,” said Illia. “It&#8217;s about blending scalable solutions with user-centric experiences, with the B.O.S. becoming the essential entry point into Web3 for both users and developers.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-asia-s-role-in-mainstream-adoption-and-regulatory-hurdles">Asia’s role in mainstream adoption and regulatory hurdles</h2>



<p>The push for mainstream blockchain adoption in APAC was also in focus on Day One, with NEAR Foundation CMO Jack Collier leading a panel discussion on current adoption challenges and how APAC can potentially lead the way in overcoming them.</p>



<p>“I’m extremely bullish on gaming as a key part of mass adoption,” opined Don Pham, Google Cloud’s regional Web3 specialist. “Vietnam is the birthplace of Axie Infinity, which is just the beginning of blockchain gaming’s potential. Use cases like loyalty, gaming, and music NFTs combined with better UX will likely be the path forward.”</p>



<p>The discussion dove deeper into the importance of user experience in the adoption of blockchain. Marieke reiterated that while technology forms the backbone, the real test will be simplifying the user journey, which can significantly hasten adoption across the APAC region as well as globally.</p>



<p>Regulation was also in focus with a panel about blockchain policies and APAC&#8217;s vision for governments and associations. Mary Beth Buchanan, a board member of the Cardano Foundation, drove home the need for regulatory clarity while discussing regional frameworks in countries like Hong Kong.</p>



<p>“The biggest challenge is not necessarily regulation, but lack of clarity,” observed Buchanan. “If regulations are unclear that will cause investors not to want to invest in the space. Builders become hesitant to build and users aren’t going to know what the rules are. Regulators need to recognize that clarity is what everyone wants.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotlight-on-artificial-intelligence-during-the-afternoon-sessions">Spotlight on Artificial Intelligence during the afternoon sessions</h2>



<p>Day One of NEAR APAC dedicated a significant chunk of its schedule to exploring the intricate interplay between AI and blockchain, particularly their role in APAC’s future technology and Web3 landscape. Illia took the stage just after the lunch break to discuss the Convergence of AI and Web3, diving deep into AI-empowered DAO and the future of AI-assisted work.</p>



<p>“While technologies like ChatGPT have found product market fit, much of AI is still siloed and doesn’t empower open source communities and projects,” Illia posited. “Web3 can operate in the middle, with AI models incorporating all participants and data sources. DAOs, for example, can be co-piloted by AI to achieve goals and KPIs faster and more efficiently.”</p>



<p>In the following panel discussion entitled “The Roles of Blockchains in an AI World,” Illia was joined by several AI and blockchain experts from the APAC region. One of the more distinguished panel members was Dr. Nguyen An Khuong, a lecturer and blockchain researcher from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, who provided an academic perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have a lot of research endeavors in Vietnam around ensuring AI&#8217;s ethical applications using blockchain,” commented Dr. Nguyen. “We’re looking at how transparency and accountability in AI decisions can be drastically improved with blockchain technology. Combining a neutral AI with a blockchain’s public ledger could enhance the ecosystem and foster wider adoption.”</p>



<p>Illia drove home that the potential “Skynet” scenario of AI taking over the world is mostly a projection of what humans might do if they were given supercomputing powers. In reality, developments like the B.O.S. and NEAR Tasks will aid humans in success and productivity, with AI agents acting as middlemen for assistance, sourcing, and even creativity.</p>



<p>Day One of the first-ever NEAR APAC was a rousing success, with these highlights just being the tip of the iceberg. The crowd was treated to bánh mì’s and Manga cosplay during lunch, B.O.S. building and gaming workshops on the Builder Stage, and an awe-inspiring NFT gallery from APAC creators.</p>



<p>As the sun sets in Saigon, the NEAR Foundation couldn’t be more appreciative of the Vietnamese crypto community. The momentum rolls on tomorrow with Day Two, so stay tuned for more updates and insights around emerging APAC trends in Web3, how blockchain gaming is taking off in Asia-Pacific, and local DeFi developments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Day One was any indication, the NEAR community’s growth, presence, and development in APAC will only continue accelerating through 2023 and beyond!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the things the NEAR Foundation has always been most proud of is the passion and enthusiasm of our builders and grassroots projects — something we have seen demonstrated again since the <a href="/blog/an-update-on-the-ndc-funding-and-support-for-grassroots-projects/?_gl=1%2A1nhhje7%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2AMTE0NTY2MjU3OS4xNjkyOTY4MDg2%2A_ga_9GWCXQJ62J%2AMTY5Mjk2ODA4NC4xLjAuMTY5Mjk2ODA4NC4wLjAuMA..">recent post</a> about the NDC. Over the past week alone, over 30 projects have reached out to the Ecosystem Team and a number of conversations are already underway. This has allowed NEAR Foundation to begin mapping out current needs, and understand the best way to provide support that will ensure the NEAR ecosystem remains a vibrant, open, and accessible place to build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For us at the Foundation, hearing directly from builders provides invaluable insight into the state of the ecosystem and how we can best continue to support the people and projects that make it what it is. What we have heard so far is that while financial support is important as the NDC fully ramps up, every project has a unique set of needs that requires a holistic approach to provide the right support, and that simply re-starting a grants program is not the right solution. To make sure that we get as many perspectives from across the ecosystem, we will be leaving the form open for one more week (until September 4th) to give anyone who needs support a chance to have their voice heard.</p>



<p>Once the form is closed and we have had a chance to review all of the inputs, we will then begin setting out a broader plan — in alignment with the NDC —&nbsp;to ensure projects get the support they need as we continue moving forward on the path to decentralization. The moment we have the full insights from these conversations, which should be within the next few weeks, we will share them in a follow-up blog post along with a clear plan on how we will be moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are excited to have so much interest from builders, and look forward to creating a plan that can help keep grassroots projects engaged and building.</p>



<p>You can sign up for a time to speak with the Ecosystem Relations Team <a href="https://airtable.com/app5mCfwTVtmOhfHW/shrbpLz5XQHqrt4rQ">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The collaboration is set to accelerate the creation of dApps that will onboard billions of users into the open web. The new <a href="https://bos.quickswap.exchange/">Polygon zkEVM dashboard </a>now combines the benefits of zero-knowledge technology with the power of the BOS to unlock <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVu4Hc1CLao">even more seamless onboarding</a> to the open web. </p>



<p>The dashboard brings a new suite of zero knowledge development capabilities to zkEVM developers and lets them build apps that can reach more users from day one. It’s a groundbreaking partnership that brings together the NEAR and Polygon ecosystems, two of the most innovative names in Ethereum and blockchain scalability.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">NEAR makes waves with sustainability commitment</h2>



<p>NEAR Foundation made a significant stride in its commitment to Web3 sustainability. As part of its ongoing efforts, NEAR signed up to the Ethereum Climate Platform, demonstrating its resolve towards minimizing the environmental impact of Web3 development. This move aligns with NEAR’s ethos and commitment to sustainable and scalable blockchain solutions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Marieke storms the BOS-tille at “Funding the Commons”</h2>



<p>Adding to the list of notable NEAR occurrences during ETHCC, NEAR Foundation CEO, Marieke Flament, was a keynote speaker at the “Funding the Commons” event held at Sorbonne Université on July 15. Marike’s message was one of bringing more ethics and equity to the entire blockchain and Web3 ecosystem.</p>



<p>In her speech, titled &#8220;The Open Web is NEAR: How the BOS, NDC, and DAOs are creating a Decentralized Web,” Marieke explored how NEAR Foundation serves the ecosystem by building public goods like the BOS, DevHub, NDC, DAOs, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Funding the Commons” is an event designed to complement the Ethereum Community Conference, promoting connection amongst participants, and fostering new collaborations and projects. The event organizers also planned a dinner on July 15 at Le Procope Paris, where Marieke was among the most notable invited guests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unpacking Insights: notable talks and events at ETH CC</h2>



<p>Near @ ETHCC wasn&#8217;t just a gathering of blockchain enthusiasts, but a hotbed of innovative discussions. Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR, and Nadir Dabit&#8217;s conversation around decentralized social networks piqued particular interest. They hinted at a shift in how we&#8217;ll connect and share information in the future and the potential role of decentralized social on the BOS.</p>



<p>Matt Stephenson, head of crypto economics at crypto investment firm, Pantera Capital, took the audience on a thrilling Day Two journey through the intricacies of behavioral game theory. He showcased how game theory could be leveraged in this space, offering a unique lens to examine, understand, and potentially predict blockchain trends.</p>



<p>Near @ ETHCC didn&#8217;t skimp on forward-looking conversations either. A panel featuring Max Mersch of Fabric Ventures, Maggie Love from SheFi, and Bilal El Alamy of PyratzLabs posed a pertinent question: &#8220;What’s the Next Big Use Case Being Built in the Bear Market?&#8221; Each speaker provided valuable insight about both challenges and opportunities posed by bear markets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ecosystem Updates</h2>



<p>Despite the focus on the Near @ ETHCC side event itself, the NEAR ecosystem saw significant developments and milestones during the past few days.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The NEAR Digital Collective’s I-AM-HUMAN</strong> movement has crossed 2,000 members in the NEAR ecosystem. The initiative allows users to vote, elect candidates for office, and shape the future of NEAR.

<p>But this doesn’t need to be the case,” she explained. “Technology can and should be in the service of all people. But to achieve this, we will need a change in perspective, something that Web3 can help us achieve.”</p>



<p>Marieke also talked about blockchain, Web3, and BOS on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lXz1gd9ErI">podcast hosted by the editor Journal du Coin</a> &#8211; France’s leading crypto media outlet, and for a video interview with <a href="https://ffnews.com/fintech-tv/event/event-videos-2023/paris-fintech-forum-leaders-summit-2023/marieke-flament-near-foundation-paris-fintech-forum/">Fintech Finance</a> at the Paris Fintech Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to announce a new strategic partnership with MARBLEX, a blockchain subsidiary of Netmarble Corp, that will help expand Korea’s Web3 gaming industry. MARBLEX will build on Aurora, NEAR’s Ethereum-compatible layer, for maximum scalability and blockchain gaming accessibility to onboard more players to Web3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new partnership facilitated by the NEAR Korea Hub, NEAR Foundation and MARBLEX plan to achieve mutual growth by linking the NEAR blockchain and Aurora with WARP Bridge to enable interactive collaboration, promote global joint marketing events, and enhance brand awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Through WARP Bridge, competitive and casual gamers alike will now be able to enjoy a variety of games and exclusive content through NEAR’s Blockchain Operating System (BOS). The BOS leverages the NEAR Protocol’s fast transaction speeds as well as effortless scalability and onboarding (via FastAuth) to make the onboarding experience as easy as possible for the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marblex-a-developer-and-publisher-of-mobile-games">MARBLEX: a developer and publisher of mobile games</h2>



<p>A Web3 gaming giant constantly pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible, MARBLEX is a well-established developer and publisher of mobile games with more than 6,000 experts from across the globe. MARBLEX’s goal is to bring the highest quality Web3 games to market by providing key services such as a cryptocurrency wallet, decentralized exchange, token staking, and an NFT Marketplace.<br><br>“We expect NEAR’s core narrative to play a pivotal role in bolstering the overall MBX 3.0 ecosystem,” said Junki Moon, Business Division Director of MARBLEX added. “Through the collaborative integration of the NEAR Foundation’s extensive technical expertise with the content prowess of the MBX ecosystem, we will maintain our position as pioneers in the ever-evolving landscape of the global blockchain trends.”<br></p>



<p>Robbie Lim, GM of Business Development at NEAR Foundation, added: “This collaboration with MARBLEX will be an important milestone in promoting various use cases based on BOS (Blockchain Operating System). We will continuously advance the gaming ecosystem of NEAR Protocol as well as attract numerous users to enter the Web3 scene by onboarding high-quality MBX content.”</p>



<p>NEAR Korea Hub, which oversees business development in Korea and Asia, played a key role in this strategic partnership. The Hub also sees the partnership as breaking a barrier to Web3 entry for mobile gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>“NEAR Protocol provides a user experience similar to Web2 using Fast Auth account abstraction feature, greatly lowering the initial entry barrier to Web3,” said a spokesperson from NEAR Korea Hub. “We will continue to strongly partner with excellent domestic companies such as MARBLEX to implement a user-centered ecosystem where users can easily enjoy all services.”</p>
