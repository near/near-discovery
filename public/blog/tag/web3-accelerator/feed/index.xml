<p><em>NEAR is a home to a number of amazing apps and projects. These developers, founders, and entrepreneurs are using NEAR to effortlessly create and distribute innovative decentralized apps, while helping build a more open web — free from centralized platforms. In these Case Study videos, NEAR Foundation showcases some of these projects.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the latest NEAR Foundation Case Study video, viewers hear from Laura Cunningham, Team Lead at NEAR Horizon and General Manager at NEAR Foundation. NEAR Horizon is a Web3 accelerator program revolutionizing how founders and builders receive support in the open web. Laura takes viewers on a deep dive into Horizon’s startup accelerator marketplace, which the Horizon team built on the Blockchain Operating System (BOS). </p>



<p>“The BOS was our platform of choice for building NEAR Horizon because it makes Horizon much more accessible to founders and projects that are already in the ecosystem. And then ones coming in new, you can be building on another chain as long as you have some component of your stack on NEAR then you can apply and be part of NEAR Horizon,  ” she adds. “It is also incredibly composable, so we were able to fork different attributes that were already available on BOS and make use of them in our front end, so it made it a lot quicker to actually develop.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hello Nearians,</p>



<p>We are more than halfway through the first quarter of 2023 and wanted to share a quick update on the progress NEAR Foundation has made on community funding and accelerator strategies.</p>



<p>First, if you are a project building on NEAR or interested in building on NEAR and need some immediate support, please fill out this <a href="https://airtable.com/shrQk2yWacIj2QA3E">Project Support Form</a>. NEAR Foundation will connect you with the appropriate person or organization who can assist.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decentralizing-funding">Decentralizing Funding</h2>



<p>Important <a href="/blog/refining-near-foundations-grant-approach/">changes in the grant program</a> were announced at the start of January, highlighting the Foundation’s goal for a more decentralized funding process by handing over decision making to community DAOs. What follows is the status of the initial DAOs.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>MarketingDAO</strong> is actively reviewing proposals related to amplification and marketing via the <a href="https://gov.nearpages.wpengine.com/c/marketing/marketingdao">MarketingDAO forum channel</a>. At the moment, the core focus of applications is around content and social media, with an exciting <a href="https://gov.nearpages.wpengine.com/t/introducing-the-near-day-community-content-bounty-program-for-eth-denver-2023/32935/9">ETHDenver bounties</a> initiative having just recently been announced.

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-accelerator">The Accelerator</h2>



<p>From the accelerator side, NEAR Foundation’s past experience with the grants program showed us that founders and teams are in need of a variety of support in order to be successful and take their project to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To that end, the Foundation’s strategy consists of <strong>three elements</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>We are building a product on NEAR Discovery that will allow founders to connect with a range of contributors (e.g., investors, subject matter experts in areas like legal and finance) who can support them in their journey. We are launching an MVP in early March.
<ol>
<li>If you are a founder, investor, mentor, or subject matter expert interested in being a beta tester, please fill out this <a href="https://airtable.com/shrALYWH9TBQr8jxh">form</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you are a founder interested in participating in paid user research, please fill out this <a href="https://survey.alchemer.eu/s3/90526683/Research-Plan-NEAR-Foundation-Project-Journey">form</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2">
<li>We recently made <a href="/blog/open-call-for-near-accelerator-partners/">an open call to partner with accelerator programs</a> that can help us fast track support needs for projects. We will be releasing additional open calls in the coming weeks as we continue building out the support network available for founders. These open calls will be for:
<ol>
<li>Engineering support resources</li>



<li>Talent / Recruitment platforms and services</li>



<li>Legal platforms and services</li>



<li>Back office accounting platforms and services</li>



<li>Marketing services</li>



<li>Product management services</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3">
<li>We are continuously developing and identifying learning content and tooling that are most helpful for early stage founders (e.g., accounting software geared towards Web3 teams, Go To Market exemplars, etc.). These resources will be available within the product.</li>
</ol>



<p><em>Take 1 minute to help us pick a name for the Accelerator </em><a href="https://airtable.com/shrN84QjGEOTqTCKL"><em>here</em></a><em> (survey closes on March 1, 2023)!</em></p>



<p>If you have any questions on decentralized funding, the DAOs, and Accelerator program, please reach out to the Community Team on <a href="https://t.me/cryptonear">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/UY9Xf2k">Discord</a>, and other social media channels used by the NEAR community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And again, if your project is building on NEAR or interested in doing so and you are in need of some immediate support, fill out this <a href="https://airtable.com/shrQk2yWacIj2QA3E">Project Support Form</a>. NEAR Foundation will connect you with the appropriate person or organization who can assist.&nbsp;</p>
