										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The NEAR Foundation announced today that Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol, has been appointed NEAR Foundation CEO to lead the NEAR ecosystem into the next phase of building an open web. As the person who has driven the vision for NEAR from the very beginning, there is no one better to oversee the growth of the NEAR Open Web Ecosystem and guide the constellation of teams building on NEAR to work together towards that common vision. From the earliest days of NEAR, Illia’s vision of an open web has guided the development of the ecosystem and served as a north star for the Foundation. In his new role as CEO, he will be able to realize that vision in a more direct and streamlined way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m honored and excited to officially join the NEAR Foundation and continue working together with the ecosystem to build towards our shared vision of an open web,” said Illia Polosukhin about his new role. “Effectively coordinating a decentralized ecosystem involves a lot of iteration and experimentation and I’m proud that NEAR has committed to refining this process since the very beginning. I believe this next step in our shared evolution will help us build our respective verticals faster and work together more efficiently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With his ability to bring together key nodes and align people across the ecosystem, Illia has always been a powerful guiding force for NEAR, something that his new role will allow him to continue and expand. As NEAR cements its position as the entry point to an open web, Illia’s appointment will help to create common work streams across the organization and broader ecosystem organizations that will help accelerate this journey. Combining a decentralized ecosystem approach with a more streamlined strategic coordination function will accelerate NEAR into its next phase of evolution, the details of which Illia will share at this week’s NEARCON.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help ensure the ecosystem nodes building this open web vision are coordinating effectively, Chris Donovan will be stepping into the position of NEAR Foundation COO to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Foundation, and will also remain as a member of the NEAR Foundation Council. Chris has been essential in this transition to a founder-led organization, and the Foundation and the whole ecosystem extend gratitude and appreciation for his work.</p>



<p>With a clear vision, strong leadership, an engaged ecosystem, and a passionate community all building towards a common vision, NEAR is poised to take its next bold step into an open web. All members of the NEAR community are invited to join this week for the biggest, most exciting NEARCON ever in Lisbon, or tune in virtually at nearcon.org starting Wednesday, November 8. You won’t want to miss the chance to hear exciting announcements and strategy updates from Illia, demos from top projects across the ecosystem, and leading perspectives from the Web3 industry during three days of talks, hackathons, and celebration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://coin98.com/">Coin98</a>, the multichain wallet and DeFi platform, has today launched a decentralized dapp store for its 7 million users across 170 countries, built on NEAR.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-app">Super app</a>, designed to seamlessly connect a billion users to the crypto world safely and securely, has created an innovative marketplace that allows users to access a range of apps on prominent Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystems such as Polygon zkEVM, zkSync, Base, and Linea, greatly increasing accessibility and discoverability for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is a both a <a href="https://dapps.coin98.com/menu/bos">web app</a> and mobile app (details below) that provides a gateway to more than 70 chains and 15,000 dapps including cross-chain bridging, money markets, and decentralized exchanges — all in a single interface. Coin98 has achieved this by harnessing the power of NEAR’s B.O.S, the Blockchain Operating System.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At Coin98, we are dedicated to providing our users with the very best one-stop DeFi experience in our pursuit of the vision to make Web3 accessible for everyone.” says Thanh Le, Coin98 Founder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With NEAR’s B.O.S, we can create a user-friendly interface thanks to its composability, while enabling decentralization under the hood,” he said. “Our dapp store offers hassle-free interaction with the most exciting L2s in the market. Soon, we will expand our collection to offer even more ecosystems and dapps, as B.O.S greatly reduces the development process, enabling a fast and scalable way to integrate new applications.”</p>



<p>Coin98 selected NEAR’s B.O.S thanks to the ease in the development process. All the widgets and components running on the B.O.S are fully composable, enabling developers to freely combine them to fit their needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coin98 utilized the B.O.S as a frontend layer to fully decentralize the user experience. Instead of routing parts of the process through centralized servers, all the featured dapps on the Coin98 gateway have frontend components whose code are stored on-chain on NEAR, which directly interact with the smart contracts on the original chains. No centralized servers are used.</p>



<p>“The NEAR ecosystem is excited to see Coin98 build their decentralized app store on the B.O.S and deliver much better experiences to their users,” says Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is exactly why we set out to build the B.O.S: because NEAR’s technology can help founders achieve decentralization and discoverability in parallel,” he added. “Now Coin98’s users can explore multiple L2 ecosystems all in one app, through the wallet of their choice, in seconds, with no complexity or switching costs. NEAR’s mission is to drive mainstream adoption of the Open Web through great user experiences and we hope more founders and projects will join us on the B.O.S.”</p>



<p>Coin98’s decentralized app store offering follows the launches of major B.O.S gateways by <a href="/blog/interactive-polygon-zkevm-app-dashboard-launches-on-the-near-blockchain-operating-system/">Polygon zkEVM</a> and <a href="/blog/mantle-ecosystem-gateway-launches-on-the-near-blockchain-operating-system-b-o-s/?_gl=1%2A7ub265%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_ga%2ANTkxMzY4NDg1LjE2OTg2ODA1NTQ.%2A_ga_9GWCXQJ62J%2AMTY5ODY4MDU1MS4xLjEuMTY5ODY4MDY1Mi4wLjAuMA..">Mantle</a>, two top L2 ecosystems. The success of these wallet gateway partners highlights the benefits that B.O.S helps Web3 founders deliver to end-users, demonstrating NEAR&#8217;s commitment to enabling products that simplify the blockchain experience and globally expand access to the Open Web.</p>



<p>Want to try the new B.O.S integration? Download the mobile app on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin98-super-wallet/id1561969966">Apple</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=coin98.crypto.finance.media&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Google Play </a>store today.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Mailchain brings encrypted communication to NEAR-based dApps</h3>



<p>Mailchain, an open source, multi-chain communication layer for Web3, announced integration with NEAR. Now, NEAR developers can send encrypted messages between blockchain wallet addresses with simple, unified inbox to view and send messages and keep track of on-chain activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NEAR’s vision has always been to onboard the next billion users to the Open Web. With Mailchain, these next billion users can communicate natively with one another, regardless of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mailchain’s integration with NEAR is a significant step towards strengthening the interoperability mission of NEAR&#8217;s blockchain operating system (BOS). NEAR’s BOS and Mailchain are both chain-agnostic, prioritize usability and security, and together make Web3 more accessible and interoperable for users.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our vision aligns perfectly with NEAR’s&#8211;to onboard the next billion users,&#8221; said Tim Boeckmann, CEO of Mailchain. &#8220;When building Mailchain, we knew these next billion users would want to communicate with what mattered most to them, their blockchain identities. Mailchain&#8217;s secure communication protocol makes this a reality. We believe that this integration is a big step forwards for the developers who are building the next generation of the Internet.&#8221;</p>
