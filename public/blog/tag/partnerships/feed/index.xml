<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to announce a strategic partnership with <a href="https://blumer.cc/">Blumer</a>, Colombia&#8217;s first Web3 social network. This collaboration signifies a new era in social media where active users are incentivized for their contributions, marking a transformative shift in the user-social platform dynamic.</p>



<p>By harnessing the strengths of blockchain technology and integrating them with the vibrant world of social networking, this partnership aims to challenge the status quo, prioritizing user privacy, compensation, and education. It&#8217;s a pioneering effort that not only champions user-centric design, but also sets the stage for a more inclusive digital future in Latin America.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blumer-revolutionizing-social-media-through-blockchain-technology">Blumer: Revolutionizing Social Media through Blockchain Technology</h2>



<p>Blumer, the first Web3 social network created and developed in Colombia, is an innovative platform that combines the functionality of traditional social networks with the advantages of blockchain technology. What makes Blumer so unique is that users are compensated for time spent on social media, distributing 18% of its advertising revenue back to its community.</p>



<p>“At Blumer, we believe in creating a social network for everyone,” says Ernesto Ruiz, Blumer’s CEO. “Our platform is designed to be a space where users can express themselves, connect with friends, and learn about the crypto world. We’re committed to creating a platform that is fun, engaging, and rewarding for everyone involved.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Ruiz alludes to, Blumer users can monetize their time spent on social media through a variety of activities like consuming advertisements, selling NFTs, and performing crypto transactions. This not only promotes user engagement but emphasizes a novel approach to commercial growth, derived largely from businesses undertaking digital marketing.</p>



<p>Blumer isn’t just social media landscape but reshaping the whole digital economy narrative. Its unique approach of monetizing user engagement and activity on social media paves the way for a paradigm shift in user interaction and value creation. Let&#8217;s now delve into how this innovative platform aims to advance the adoption of Web3 in Latin America, one educated user at a time.</p>



<p>“This partnership is a significant step towards creating a fair and transparent social media ecosystem,” adds Marieke Flament, CEO of NEAR Foundation. “By combining the benefits of blockchain technology with social media, we are set to revolutionize how we interact on social platforms.“</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-educating-users-and-advancing-latin-american-web3-adoption">Educating users and advancing Latin American Web3 adoption</h2>



<p>Blumer also tackles the significant challenges facing cryptocurrency adoption in Latin America —&nbsp;namely, the lack of knowledge, understanding, and real market usability. Through ZVerso, its free crypto education platform, Blumer is empowering users with the knowledge to confidently engage within the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By providing users with essential blockchain education and tools, Blumer is making strides toward democratizing access to Web3 technologies. This proactive educational initiative aligns with a broader vision for a more decentralized, inclusive, and user-centric digital future in Latin America.</p>



<p>With an online population of over 54 million people, Latin America and the Caribbean form the fifth-largest global market for social media. South America alone boasts over 30 million users. The NEAR and Blumer partnership provides a unique opportunity to tap into this thriving hub and bolster the adoption of Web3 solutions.</p>



<p>“With NEAR&#8217;s support, we are confident that we can achieve our vision and create a social network fit to thrive in tomorrow’s landscape,” Ruiz adds.</p>



<p>The collaboration between NEAR and Blumer signifies a pivotal stride towards fostering a fair, transparent, and user-centric social media ecosystem. As Blumer forges ahead with innovative advancements in decentralized social networking, the NEAR Foundation and ecosystem give one big “Like” to Blumer’s mission of a user-empowered social network.</p>

<p>NEAR Foundation is thrilled to announce a new strategic partnership with Hibiki Run, a platform lying at the nexus of innovation in music streaming and digital collectibles. Hibiki Run is revolutionizing music discovery by melding gaming thrills with crypto-driven Listen-to-Earn&nbsp; (L2E) incentives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, NEAR Foundation and Hibiki Run will explore innovative paths for creating engagement between Web3 content creators and end users. With the Japanese “Gachapon” vending machine capsule toys as a model, the collaboration will meld NEAR’s cutting-edge blockchain technology with Hibiki Run’s expertise in digital music, art, and exercise, new opportunities in each vertical for creation, distribution, and ownership.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bringing-a-digital-gachapon-economy-to-the-open-web">Bringing a ‘Digital Gachapon’ economy to the open web</h2>



<p>With “Digital Gachapon”, NEAR and Hibiki Run will bring a powerful economic tool to creators. When interacting with a Japanese Gachapon, layers insert coins into the machine, turn the knob, and receive a capsule with a random item.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hibiki Run has innovatively digitized this exciting concept, integrating it with blockchain technology. In the digital Gachapon system, users utilize their tokens to receive digital items such as NFTs or unique digital assets — anything from exclusive music tracks, collectible art pieces, and rare gaming items, to access tokens for specific events or experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The digital Gachapon&#8217;s strength lies in its element of surprise and the potential for rare, high-value rewards — transforming the token expenditure into an exciting event while providing a way for creators to distribute their content in a fun and engaging manner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hibiki Run and NEAR hope that with these types of innovative concepts, blockchain technology, and user-friendly interfaces, a new frontier of digital arts will open up. One that is interactive and immersive for creators and consumers alike. Like NEAR, Hibiki Run is committed to creating a decentralized, fair, and accessible ecosystem for artists.&nbsp;</p>

Illia sets out the emerging problem with the status quo: bad actors are beginning to utilize generative AI to dramatically scale up misinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Illia explains that blockchain-based “sign-and-trace” systems can enable the public to reliably source and validate real news stories, with a legitimate trail of sources available online.</p>



<p>CEO of NEAR Foundation Marieke Flament also penned an article for London’s leading daily business paper <a href="https://www.cityam.com/city-am-web3-building-a-fair-open-and-inclusive-digital-world/">CityAM</a> about using Web3 to build a fair and inclusive digital world.  “Too often technology has only benefited the few: those who have money, those who have power, or those of a certain gender, ethnicity, or skin color.</p>



<p>But this doesn’t need to be the case,” she explained. “Technology can and should be in the service of all people. But to achieve this, we will need a change in perspective, something that Web3 can help us achieve.”</p>



<p>Marieke also talked about blockchain, Web3, and BOS on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lXz1gd9ErI">podcast hosted by the editor Journal du Coin</a> &#8211; France’s leading crypto media outlet, and for a video interview with <a href="https://ffnews.com/fintech-tv/event/event-videos-2023/paris-fintech-forum-leaders-summit-2023/marieke-flament-near-foundation-paris-fintech-forum/">Fintech Finance</a> at the Paris Fintech Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.skoda-auto.co.in/">Škoda India</a>, in collaboration with NEAR Protocol, announces its foray into the world of NFTs and blockchain technology with Škodaverse India. This new platform forms a part of the global Škodaverse initiative and will bring<strong> </strong>a fresh wave of digital innovation to Škoda automobile fans in India.</p>



<p>Škoda, one of Europe’s biggest car manufacturers headquartered in the Czech Republic, is quickly becoming one of the most forward-thinking industry brands in Web3 and the metaverse. Late last year, the company announced its <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/skoda-enters-metaverse-skodaverse/">global Škodaverse initiative</a>, integrating virtual test drives and NFTs into an immersive environment.</p>



<p>And now the Škodaverse is coming to the Indian market, powered by the NEAR Protocol, that will enable Škoda fans to buy, trade, and engage with NFTs in Web3. It’s a crucial step in the brand&#8217;s journey towards building a tight-knit community of Škoda loyalists, offering a space for fans to connect, co-create, and establish long-term relationships with the brand.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steering-skoda-fans-towards-nfts-with-near"><strong>Steering Škoda fans towards NFTs with NEAR</strong></h2>



<p>Mr. Christian Cahn von Seelen – Executive Director of Sales, Marketing, and Digital, Škoda at Auto Volkswagen India – expressed excitement at the unveiling of the Škodaverse India NFT platform.

The Škodaverse India will offer unique and immersive experiences to a rapidly growing market.</p>



<p>“Škodaverse India signifies the brand&#8217;s leap into uncharted digital territory,” said von Seelen.

It also showcases our commitment to sustainability and innovation, through leveraging carbon-neutral blockchain technology that enables secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions.”</p>



<p>Škodaverse India is designing its metaverse platform to be exciting and engaging for Škoda enthusiasts of all demographics, whether they&#8217;re familiar with blockchain technology or not. Whether it’s an image, video, sound, or ticket, each NFT collection released on the Škodaverse India platform will be curated to create memorable driving experiences</p>



<p>The first NFT collection, honoring sustainability, will be created on NEAR Protocol. As a South Pole-certified, carbon-neutral blockchain, NEAR’s eco-first philosophy aligns seamlessly with Škoda India’s sustainability efforts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-driving-skoda-india-s-web3-strategy-into-the-future"><strong>Driving Škoda India’s Web3 Strategy into the future</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the brand&#8217;s intensified Web3 strategy, Škoda Auto India is collaborating with Antier, a leading blockchain consulting firm, to foster the creation and minting of innovative NFTs. Each NFT collection released on the Škodaverse India platform will be thoughtfully curated to represent memorable driving experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These unique collectibles will unlock exclusive experiences, strengthening the bond between Škodaverse and its community of users. The Škodaverse India platform also ensures users stay updated with the latest in the creation and sale of NFTs.

<p>With the launch of Škodaverse India, Škoda Auto India embraces blockchain technology, signaling a significant move towards Web3 applications.

<p></p>



<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to announce a new strategic partnership with MARBLEX, a blockchain subsidiary of Netmarble Corp, that will help expand Korea’s Web3 gaming industry. MARBLEX will build on Aurora, NEAR’s Ethereum-compatible layer, for maximum scalability and blockchain gaming accessibility to onboard more players to Web3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new partnership facilitated by the NEAR Korea Hub, NEAR Foundation and MARBLEX plan to achieve mutual growth by linking the NEAR blockchain and Aurora with WARP Bridge to enable interactive collaboration, promote global joint marketing events, and enhance brand awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>Through WARP Bridge, competitive and casual gamers alike will now be able to enjoy a variety of games and exclusive content through NEAR’s Blockchain Operating System (BOS). The BOS leverages the NEAR Protocol’s fast transaction speeds as well as effortless scalability and onboarding (via FastAuth) to make the onboarding experience as easy as possible for the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marblex-a-developer-and-publisher-of-mobile-games">MARBLEX: a developer and publisher of mobile games</h2>



<p>A Web3 gaming giant constantly pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible, MARBLEX is a well-established developer and publisher of mobile games with more than 6,000 experts from across the globe. MARBLEX’s goal is to bring the highest quality Web3 games to market by providing key services such as a cryptocurrency wallet, decentralized exchange, token staking, and an NFT Marketplace.<br><br>“We expect NEAR’s core narrative to play a pivotal role in bolstering the overall MBX 3.0 ecosystem,” said Junki Moon, Business Division Director of MARBLEX added. “Through the collaborative integration of the NEAR Foundation’s extensive technical expertise with the content prowess of the MBX ecosystem, we will maintain our position as pioneers in the ever-evolving landscape of the global blockchain trends.”<br></p>



<p>Robbie Lim, GM of Business Development at NEAR Foundation, added: “This collaboration with MARBLEX will be an important milestone in promoting various use cases based on BOS (Blockchain Operating System). We will continuously advance the gaming ecosystem of NEAR Protocol as well as attract numerous users to enter the Web3 scene by onboarding high-quality MBX content.”</p>



<p>NEAR Korea Hub, which oversees business development in Korea and Asia, played a key role in this strategic partnership. The Hub also sees the partnership as breaking a barrier to Web3 entry for mobile gamers.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>“NEAR Protocol provides a user experience similar to Web2 using Fast Auth account abstraction feature, greatly lowering the initial entry barrier to Web3,” said a spokesperson from NEAR Korea Hub. “We will continue to strongly partner with excellent domestic companies such as MARBLEX to implement a user-centered ecosystem where users can easily enjoy all services.”</p>

<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to announce a new partnership with <a href="https://absolutelabs.io/">Absolute Labs</a>, a company revolutionizing Web3’s marketing stack. Its “Wallet Relationship Management™ platform can be used by Web2 brands and Web3 startups alike to acquire, convert and retain customers on the Open Web. </p>



<p>To help in this endeavor, the company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/absolute-labs-announces-8-million-150000487.html">announced</a> an $8M seed round of funding at NFT NYC in the past week. Other funding partners include backers like Samsung Next, Aglae Ventures, Sparkle Ventures (Animoca Brands), The Luxury Fund and MoonPay. </p>



<p>”We are thrilled to have the NEAR Foundation as a partner in helping us to accelerate how marketing is done in the next Internet,” says Samir Addamine, Absolute Labs’ CEO and co-founder. “Both our organizations share a vision to accelerate the world’s transition to decentralized marketplaces and more open, transparent and valued user engagement, so it’s a great fit for us.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-wallet-relationship-management">What is Wallet Relationship Management</h2>



<p>Wallet Relationship Management (WRM™) starts with the premise that wallets hold the keys to everything Web3 — from proving identity, providing access to value-rich brand experiences, facilitating payments, creating “ownership” opportunities for customers, and much more. Combining on-chain data from wallets along with assets that Web2 brands can also inject from their Web2 systems, this platform supports all facets of the marketing funnel, from acquisition to conversion and retention of loyalty.</p>



<p>Users of the platform can gain deep insights into their customers and their on-chain preferences and behaviors, identify actionable segments to track and engage, and craft cross-chain and cross-channel (Web2 and Web3) campaigns to develop and nurture relationships</p>



<p>Absolute Labs customers can also use WRM to reactivate dormant wallet customers by using the WRM dashboard to distribute meaningful incentives such as rewards tokens, NFTs, and more. </p>



<p>To date, Absolute Labs has 40+ companies using their services. With WRM, these customers get an enterprise-grade suite of connectors and APIs to seamlessly integrate with their existing marketing tech stack. </p>



<p>Absolute Labs has an incredibly strong product and is a fantastic addition to the NEAR ecosystem. Their Wallet Relationship Management platform is a clear market leader in the burgeoning Web3 martech space, and is already an indispensable component of the modern marketing stack. By bringing Absolute Labs into the NEAR ecosystem, it creates a seamless Web3 on-ramp for brands  and will enable them to engage, retain, and reactivate customers like never before.</p>



<p>DISCLOSURE: <em>Any information shared in this announcement regarding our partnership with Absolute Labs should not be considered as a binding agreement or representation, and may be subject to change without notice. The information presented in this communication is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice. Any decisions made based on this information are solely the responsibility of the individual or entity making them.</em></p>

<p>NEAR Foundation is excited to announce that it has joined <a href="https://twitter.com/HydraVentures_">Hydra Ventures</a>, a “fund of funds” investment DAO. A first in the Web3 space, Hydra Ventures is designed to help other investment DAOs get off the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By partnering with NEAR Foundation, Hydra Ventures will open the doors to the eventual launch of the first investment DAO in the Near ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The combined expertise of the leaders that have created this fund offers a winning formula that will help provide critical funding to purpose-driven, socially impactful web3 startups,” said Marieke Flament, CEO of NEAR Foundation. “We are delighted to be playing a part in launching this DAO and look forward to seeing the role it will play in developing our ecosystem.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-decentralizing-web3-investment-with-daos">Decentralizing Web3 investment with DAOs</h2>



<p>To power the “fund of funds” investment DAO, Hydra Ventures has raised $10M in capital from NEAR Foundation, MetaCartel Ventures, ConsenSys, 1kx Ventures, Collab + Currency, Nonagon Ventures, CMT Digital, among others. Hydra Ventures aims to take a hands-on approach to support investment DAOs, from community coordination and investment practices to organizational design, incentive design, and back office/operations.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;While the first legally wrapped investment DAOs showed us what was possible, many of them have had major operating flaws which have been exposed over the years,” said Peter Pan, co-summoner of MetaCartel and Partner at 1kx Ventures. “Hydra looks to address many of these problems and ultimately emerge with a fundamentally better model for how investment DAOs should be operated. We are thrilled to have NEAR Foundation&#8217;s support in this venture.&#8221;<br><br>Hydra Ventures is incubated by <a href="https://twitter.com/thing3_xyz">Thing3</a> and <a href="https://metacartel.xyz/">MetaCartel Ventures</a> (the first and one of the most successful investment DAOs created), and backed by leading founders and thinkers in Web3. MetaCartel has incubated and made investments in several category-leading projects like Sky Mavis, Axie Infinity, Arweave, Open Zeppelin, DAOhaus, Zapper Finance, and Rarible, and were also one of the first investors in <a href="https://www.mintbase.xyz/">Mintbase</a>, an NFT marketplace built on Near. MetaCartel members include Ameen Soleimani (founder, Moloch DAO), Stani Kulechov (founder, AAVE), Roneil Rumburg (founder, Audius), Bobby Ong (founder, Coingecko), RAC (Grammy award winner), Peter Pan (Partner, 1kx Ventures), amongst others.</p>
